    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was in about 1970 when my uncle brought some demo record LPs from a
DJ he knew.  I discovered among them the 1968 electronic Moog album
&ldquo;Switched on Bach.&rdquo;  Another album that I really loved listening to
was &ldquo;The Five Bridges Suite&rdquo; by The Nice.</p>

<p>A couple of years later, in high school, in 1972, my friend Dennis
introduced me to Emerson, Lake and Palmer and their album &ldquo;Trilogy.&rdquo;
At about the same time, my friend BJ  their first album, &ldquo;Emerson, Lake
and Palmer&rdquo; and I was as blown away.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Progressive rock was blooming at the time.  The eclectic fusion of
classical, rock, jazz, blues and other music forms in long pieces,
sometimes in multiple movements, were made for long album cuts played
on FM radio The Atlanta station 96 Rock played a lot of progressive
rock in 1973-75.  With motifs of science fiction, fantasy, astronomy
and more, it was a perfect fit especially for the college listening
audience.  Bands like Yes, Pink Floyd, Genesis, and, often considered
by many the leader, Emerson, Lake and Palmer, were setting the pace
for this form of music.</p>

<p>It was years later that I finally realized the ELP line up was really
a traditional trio of keyboards, bass and drums.  Think of Vince
Guaraldi&rsquo;s jazz trio music for &ldquo;A Charlie Brown Christmas.&rdquo;  Often
ELP would transition into traditional jazz in just that format.</p>

<p>My favorite performance, that shows off the extreme range of their
playing, is &ldquo;Take A Pebble&rdquo; from a Belgian TV recording in 1971
(linked below), complete with a Moire projection that would make a
bridge science officer proud.  They were not a tight band, sometimes
lacking the precise virtuosity of a group like Chick Corea&rsquo;s Return To
Forever.  Sometimes it seemed like they didn&rsquo;t really like playing
together that much.  Still, their playing was inventive, talented, and
a joy to listen to.  This performance&rsquo;s rough edges and spontaneity
are part of what puts it at the top of my list.</p>

<p>Their music was ambitious, grand and rose high above the popular music
of the day.  Keith Emerson&rsquo;s stage antics were entertaining when I was
an adolescent but later I didn&rsquo;t care for them or for some the songs&#8217;
themes, but I sure was into the music.  That was what I enjoyed
listening to so much then and I still do today.  He introduced me to
composers like Mussorgsky, Aaron Copeland, and others the same way the
Allman Brothers led me to blues music.</p>

<p>ELP&rsquo;s first five albums stand as their main body of work, at least in
my view, but I liked the records that followed, particularly the
two-volume &ldquo;Works&rdquo; even though it was a mixture of pieces by a band
that was ending and solo pieces by its members.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t recall if it was in high school or as a freshman in college
that I made the connection for the first time between ELP and The
Nice&rsquo;s &ldquo;Five Bridges Suite,&rdquo; that album I enjoyed so much.  I went on
to become a fan of the early Nice music and collected several of their
records.  Even then Emerson was mixing Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, and Bach
with Bob Dylan and Coleman Hawkins, and performing live with a full
orchestra.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s surprisingly hard to say good bye to one of the great artists of
the time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally found the paper for the recent LIGO discovery of gravity
waves from a black hole merger, event GW150914 at 2015-09-14 09:50:45
+0000 which data implies was the merging of two black holes, one with
mass 36 (+5, -4) solar masses and the other 29 (+4, -4) solar masses
into an object of 62 (+4, -4) solar masses with 3 (+0.5, -0.5) solar
masses radiated away (lost) as emitted gravitational waves.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>B.P. Abbot and collaborators say,</p>

<blockquote><p>Over 0.2 s, the signal increases in frequency and amplitude in about 8
cycles from 35 to 150 Hz, where the amplitude reaches a maximum. The
most plausible explanation for this evolution is the inspiral of two
orbiting masses, m1 and m2, due to gravitational-wave emission.</p></blockquote>

<p>The source redshift was measured as <em>z</em>=0.09 (+0.03, -0.04).</p>

<p>One interesting outcome in the conclusions is support for massive
black holes.</p>

<blockquote><p>GW150914 demonstrates the existence of stellar-mass black holes more
massive than ≃ 25 solar masses, and establishes that binary black
holes can form in nature and merge within a Hubble time. Binary
black holes have been predicted to form both in isolated binaries
and in dense environments by dynamical interactions.  The
formation of such massive black holes from stellar evolution
requires weak massive-star winds, which are possible in stellar
environments with metallicity lower than ≃ &frac12; the solar value.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ve decided to try using the dreaded Facebook a little more,
particularly after hearing all of the talk about instant articles in
news and more people using Messenger. I knew about this podcast of
Robert Scoble (who&rsquo;s all in on Facebook) trying to teach Leo Laporte
how to use it back in August but had never gotten around to checking
it out.</p>

<p>If you want to learn how to &ldquo;really use&rdquo; Facebook in it&rsquo;s current
form, I recommend watching it and even working through this stuff.</p>

<p>So, starting around about 2016-01-30, I&rsquo;ve been trying most of what
they discuss there over the past few days and I am seeing my FB
experience much improved. There&rsquo;s a lot you can do to fine tune and
control things. I&rsquo;ll see how the news feeds compare to my Twitter
feed, etc.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow, the Olympus Pen F retro camera is quite beautiful.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Raymond Wong on Mashable says,</p>

<blockquote><p>The new PEN F is quite possibly the most retro mirrorless digital
camera the company has ever created. I dare say it&rsquo;s even more retro
than the company&rsquo;s high-end OM-D mirrorless cameras. It&rsquo;s not just
old-school aesthetics — the camera&rsquo;s got a dial on the front for
quickly switching between different color modes to emulate the look of
film.</p>

<p>The digital PEN F&rsquo;s design pays homage to the original PEN F film
camera released in 1963. The resemblance is obvious when the cameras
are next to each other. You can tell just by looking at it that the
engineers and designers sweated all of the details from the font to
the knurled metal dials.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article on using Alpine Linux for Docker microcontainers is
interesting and seems to be a valid way to make containers
significantly more lightweight.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>I didn&rsquo;t recall much about Alpine Linux so I fired up a Virtual Box
and installed it.  It&rsquo;s definitely small.  It uses BusyBox and libc is
different from the standard.  Python was there and it has a package
manager which works well enough.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t pick up the name servers with DHCP so I kept having to
manually configure resolve.conf.  That&rsquo;s a problem I&rsquo;m sure could be
solved with some research and time.</p>

<p>The most heartbreaking thing is that GNU Emacs doesn&rsquo;t work with that
clib and seems that it&rsquo;s not going to.</p>

<p>In the end I decided it was nice and small, but really if I need to
run Linux in a persistent instance, I much prefer Ubuntu Server.</p>

<p>If I ever do deploy something using Docker, then Alpine is certainly
worth consiering if it supports the app and it&rsquo;s libraries.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was recently wondering about the origin of Superman finding a phone
booth to change in.  I found one source on the origin and it was
surprising.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Why was I wondering about this in the first place?  It&rsquo;s because I was
thinking about the John Williams soundtrack from the 1978 movie.  I
recalled the scene where Clark Kent stops and glances at the little hood-like
phone booth and keeps going, looking for a place to change.  I
wondered where the changing in a phone booth meme came from since I
didn&rsquo;t recall Superman ever actually changing in a phone booth in any
of the comics or TV shows, etc.</p>

<p>A quick search online pulled up some interesting history including a
post by Steve Younis on supermanhoempage.com called &lsquo;Superman and the
Phone Booth.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>In the Golden Age of comic books Clark Kent didn&rsquo;t use a phone booth
to change into Superman. Actually right throughout every era of
Superman comics the phone booth change has rarely been seen.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first time Superman changes is (spoiler):</p>

<blockquote><p>The answer lies way back in 1941.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, Clark Kent first changed to Superman inside a phone
booth in &ldquo;The Mechanical Monsters&rdquo;, the second of 17 Superman
cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios for Paramount Pictures. It
was released to cinemas on November 28 in 1941.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was pretty much unaware of the Fleischer Studios Superman
animations.  They&rsquo;re very well done and influenced some of the more
recent TV animations in style.</p>

<p>I recommend finding &ldquo;The Mechanical Monsters&rdquo; on Youtube and watching it.</p>

service on Amazon Web Services from one to over 11 million users.
It&rsquo;s based on a talk by Joel Williams from AWS.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>He lists  these main points.</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>Start with SQL and only move to NoSQL when necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>A consistent theme is take components and separate them out. This
allows those components to scale and fail independently. It applies to
breaking up tiers and creating microservices.</p></li>
<li><p>Only invest in tasks that differentiate you as a business, don&rsquo;t
reinvent the wheel.</p></li>
<li><p>Scalability and redundancy are not two separate concepts, you can
often do both at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>There&rsquo;s no mention of costs. That would be a good addition to the talk
as that is one of the major criticisms of AWS solutions.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The section for just one user is also quite helpful.</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>Run on a single instance, maybe a type t2.micro. Instance types
comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking
capacity and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of
resources for your applications.</p></li>
<li><p>The one instance would run the entire web stack, for example: web app,
database, management, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Use Amazon Route 53 for the DNS.</p></li>
<li><p>Attach a single Elastic IP address to the instance.</p></li>

It&rsquo;s not exactly authentication but more publication of data in a
sense that it becomes part of a sequential public record.  From that
point on, it can be looked up and verified.</p>

<p>The clever part is that the public record isn&rsquo;t posted in a particular
place or location but is distributed all over, approximately to
everyone who cares.  Since everyone has a copy, they can be verified
against each other.</p>

<p>As pointed out in the article below, it&rsquo;s like publishing a snippet
about a transaction in a newspaper which is then sent out to all
subscribers.  In this case, though, the newspaper contains all of the
transactions ever published there and just keeps adding to them.  You
can see one of the first problems right there.  This growing &ldquo;ledger&rdquo;
just keeps, well, growing.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem to scale well as they say.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>A couple weeks back, I tweeted the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turns out a Raspberry Pi now is about 6× as fast as a SPARCstation 20
was 20 years ago. And a Pi 2 is more like 15× as fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was a little low in my numbers, too&mdash;they’re more like 7× and 16×
to 41× as fast&mdash;since I was going from memory!</p>

<p>Here’s how I came up with that.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>As an AWS Cloud Consultant I see many AWS accounts. During the year I
collected mistakes that I saw in each account and aggregated them to
provide you my best of. It turned out that the 5 most common mistakes
on AWS are:</p>

<ul>
<li>managing infrastructure manually</li>
<li>not using Auto Scaling Groups</li>
<li>not analyzing metrics in CloudWatch</li>
<li>ignoring Trusted Advisor</li>
<li>underutilizing virtual machines</li>
</ul>
