<p>For several months now Steve Gibson of GRC.com and Security Now has
been working on a new authentication protocol he named SQRL, the
Secure Quick Reliable Login.  On his web site he describes what
happens when you log into a site, say Amazon, using SQRL (assuming
Amazon adopted it).</p>

<p>The website displays a QR code, described as a &ldquo;SQRL code,&rdquo; beside the
usual userid and password login prompt.</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>The user can tap or click directly on the SQRL code to login, or
launch their smartphone&rsquo;s SQRL app, and scan the QR code.</li>
<li>For verification, SQRL displays the domain name contained in the
SQRL code.</li>
<li>After verifying the domain, the user permits the SQRL app to
authenticate their identity.</li>
<li>Leaving the login information blank, the user clicks the “Log in”
button&hellip; and is logged in.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The approach is highly secure, difficult to attack, easy to implement,
and easy to use.  He describes details at his site.</p>

<p>This is an elegant solution to the problems that come from dealing
with passwords and I hope it continues to climb since it&rsquo;s taken off!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2014/10/are-quasars-dying-at-the-farthest-reaches-of-the-universe.html">The Daily Galaxy</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have been able to confirm that, indeed, apart from the highly
energetic and rapidly evolving quasars, there is another population
that evolves slowly. This population of quasars appears to follow the
quasar main sequence discovered by Sulentic and colleagues in
2000. There does not even seem to be a strong relation between this
type of quasars, which we see in our environment and those &lsquo;monsters&rsquo;
that started to glow more than ten billion years ago&rdquo;, says Ascensión
del Olmo another IAA-CSIC researcher taking part in the study.</p>

<p>They have, nonetheless, found differences in this population of quiet
quasars. &ldquo;The local quasars present a higher proportion of heavy
elements such as aluminium, iron or magnesium, than the distant
relatives, which most likely reflects enrichment by the birth and
death of successive generations of stars,&rdquo; says Jack W. Sulentic
(IAA-CSIC). &ldquo;This result is an excellent example of the new
perspectives on the universe which the new 10 meter-class of
telescopes such as GTC are yielding,&rdquo; the researcher concludes.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Orbital Sciences Antares rocket&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip;flying cargo to the International Space Station
exploded just 14 seconds after lift-off last night, creating a
spectacular fireball and shockwave as the fully fuelled rocket crashed
back down onto its launch pad.</p>

<p>No one was hurt when the uncrewed spacecraft was destroyed, but the
loss will dent attempts by the spacecraft&rsquo;s builder, Orbital Sciences
Corporation of Dulles, Virginia, to build confidence in its ability to
supply ISS cargo services to NASA.</p></blockquote>

    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/29/the-19-inch-rack</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//postimages/19-in-rack.png" title="" ></p>

<p><a href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 19</a></p>

<p>Last night, while driving home, I stopped at an intersection where
work was being done on the traffic signals.  Looking at the open
control box I suddenly realized it was just a 19-inch rack inside the
silver box.  I think I even saw a network switch in there and a
surprising number of mounted devices.  That makes sense.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked around the standard 19-in racks in data centers for a long
time.  Even before that, when I was in school, it was common for a
physics lab to have a row of several 19-in racks.  They were usually
filled with instruments, controllers and maybe even an occasional
computer though microcomputers, small enough to fit in a rack, were
just beginning to appear on the scene.</p>

<p>Even large telescopes will have the standard racks mounted right on
the back of the telescope, like the 120-inch telescope here at the
Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//postimages/lick-120.jpg"></p>

<p>Where did they begin?  An on-line article &ldquo;Audio-Video Equipment
Racks&rdquo; credits Westinghouse.</p>

<blockquote><p>The origins of rack mounting dates to the days of industrialist George
Westinghouse way back in 1890. Westinghouse had first designed
19-inch shelving to house relay gear used in his railroad
industry. Eventually, early telephone companies also adopted this
19-inch width.</p></blockquote>

<p>For that reason they are sometimes called &ldquo;relay racks.&rdquo;  Wikipedia
says the relay rack name came from telephony and then appeared in
railroad signaling by 1911.</p>

<p>The Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) &ldquo;standardized them in its
310-D standard, first published in 1965.&rdquo;  That standard included the
1.75-in rack space height and the 19-in width (482.6 mm).</p>

<p>Wikipedia says,</p>

<blockquote><p>The 19-inch rack format with rack-units of 1.75 inches and holes
tapped for 12-24 screws with alternating spacings of 1.25 inches and
0.5 inch was an established standard by 1934. The EIA standard was
revised again in 1992 to comply with the 1988 public law 100-418,
setting the standard U as 44.5mm (15.9mm + 15.9mm + 12.7mm), making
each &ldquo;U&rdquo; officially 1.752 inches.</p></blockquote>

    <link href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/28/inbox-first-impression/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-28T06:01:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/28/inbox-first-impression</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 18.1</a></p>

<p>I just set up Inbox on a very old, in fact my oldest, earliest, Gmail
account.  Come to think of it, I guess that&rsquo;s appropriate in a way.
Here, briefly, are my very first impressions.</p>

<h2>Short Version</h2>

<p>Inbox is like the dead mouse your cat brings to you.  Thanks but
that&rsquo;s not exactly what I wanted and it&rsquo;s not quite useful to me,
though I appreciate the work you&rsquo;ve done.  I may even be impressed by
it.  It&rsquo;s true I could use something to eat right now, maybe even
something about that size, but that isn&rsquo;t it.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Slightly More Detail</h2>

<p>Minimalist email messages:  Yes.  I like this idea of messages that
can look like tweets but still, maybe, have support for long messages.
Really, though, I think long messages should be a document that is
emailed.</p>

<p>The card thing:  Bah.  I don&rsquo;t use Google Now and I don&rsquo;t want that
much help.</p>

<p>The todo list thing: Thumbs down.  I&rsquo;m in the fifth year of my
highly-evolved GTD system and I don&rsquo;t want help with this from my email
program.  I don&rsquo;t mind it being there, it looks like it would be a
great help for folks that <em>do</em> use email to manage their lives (what a
horrible, horrible concept, though).  There needs to be some way to
get all of those green check marks and todo-listness out of the email if you
don&rsquo;t want to see it there.  Where&rsquo;s the OFF switch??</p>

<p>The automatic grouping thing: Thumbs down again.  Similar to the
above, I&rsquo;ve had complete control of my email with filters and labels
for years.  I don&rsquo;t need help.  Please get your ideas of labels and
filters out of my email!</p>

<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s not really minimal.  Inbox looks minimal and simpler,
but really it sneaks in all of the above cruft.  A program that sort
of looked like Inbox, more minimalist than Gmail, but that didn&rsquo;t
impose a lot of complexity and stuff in return would be worth a closer
look.</p>

<p>I expect changes to Gmail itself along these lines and maybe then
there will be some settings switches (no doubt almost impossibly
buried) to turn some of these &ldquo;helpful&rdquo; features off.</p>

<p>And I should make clear that this is all from my personal point of
view.  For the vast masses, Inbox may be just what folks need so I&rsquo;m
not saying it shouldn&rsquo;t exist and may not be a huge hit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll find ways to keep playing with Inbox but it will be a while
before I unleash it on the actual Gmail that I use.</p>

<h2>P.S.</h2>

<p>It sure looks like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CICMxwgm274">Mailboxapp</a> introduced some two years ago.</p>

<p>I recently made a list of the program&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve written that I&rsquo;d consider
my favorites.  Then I made a list of the programming languages I had
used.  I think the result would qualify as a list of my favorite
programming languages.</p>

<ul>
<li>FORTRAN</li>
<li>BASIC</li>
<li>SNOBOL</li>
<li>Pascal</li>
<li>C</li>
<li>Objective-C</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>Python</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve written more code over the years in Perl and
Python.  I&rsquo;m not sure which would be in the lead at this point.</p>

<p>Two other languages, Smalltalk and LISP, are languages I really enjoy
but only in an occasional, recreational sense.  I&rsquo;ve never found either to be
useful for anything very practical.  However, it&rsquo;s a joy to write pure
object-oriented code in the wondrous Smalltalk-80-based environment of
Squeak.  Similarly, it&rsquo;s a thrill to write pure functional programs in
LISP, using Racket Scheme.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m half way to having blogged for 30 days straight.  It&rsquo;s
required keeping up with it but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it so far.  The fact that
I&rsquo;ve thrown some re-tweets and link postings in there helps.  I like
the mid-length blogging ideas and those really fit my thinking.
Short, quick posts that say something you want to say are fine!</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the best way to learn the Python programming language?  I think
the on-line tutorial at python.org is the fastest but it works best if
Python isn&rsquo;t your first language.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Backing Up</h2>

<p>I think Python is nearly the perfect language.  Okay, it&rsquo;s not really
perfect, but it&rsquo;s as close as any I can think of.  There are other
languages that might be better for some extreme, specialized cases
(which will not seem extreme or specialized to anyone who works on
them every day) such as very low-level system programming, programs
where performance is critical, maybe very large corporate software
systems (though I&rsquo;d claim Python still holds it&rsquo;s own here), as just a
few examples.</p>

<p>However, even in those instances, Python does okay.</p>

<p>There are languages for other ways of thinking about programming like
the functional languages Haskell, LISP, etc.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s great about Python is that it&rsquo;s short, clear, easy to write
once you get the hang of it, very easy to read, and it can handle
programs that range from short little scripts to very large, complex
systems.</p>

<h2>If You&rsquo;ve Programmed Before</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve written programs before, in any programming language, then
you&rsquo;ll probably be fine using the on-line tutorial for Python.  It&rsquo;s
free and on-line at Python&rsquo;s own website,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/">https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/</a>.</p>

<p>Start with chapter 1, then do 2-4.  Then skip to chapter 7 with more
input/output.  After than follow up with 5.  You can add the
additional chapters later, as you either need to or are interested.</p>

<h2>If You&rsquo;re a Beginner</h2>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve found any beginning books that I&rsquo;ve looked at and
thought, &ldquo;Yes!  That&rsquo;s the ideal Python book for a beginning
programmer.&rdquo;  I am completely convinced that Python is the best
language for learning to program since Pascal.</p>

<p>The book <em>Learn Python the Hard Way</em> Third Edition by Zed A. Shaw,
Addison-Wesley Professional, 2013, seems pretty good and complete, but
it seems slow and plodding to me.  That approach may be perfect for
you.  Pace is always relative.  The book is free on-line, available as
a PDF you can download, or you can buy the on-line version and get the
accompanying videos or buy the regular book.</p>

<p>There seem to be thousands of vidoes teaching you Python on Youtube.
As far as I&rsquo;ve looked, I&rsquo;ve not found one that I like.  There are many
that are okay, but none that I&rsquo;ve bothered to write the URL down for.</p>

<p>The book <em>Learning Python</em> Fifth Edition by Mark Lutz, O&#8217;Reilly Media,
2013 is 1600 pages! It&rsquo;s hard for me to understand how you could make
a book on Python that long and I have looked it over.  I&rsquo;m not saying
it&rsquo;s not a good book, it&rsquo;s apparently complete and I believe it
includes exercises and the new Python 3 version.  Still, wow!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a beginner, I think I&rsquo;d still say take a look at Python&rsquo;s
on-line tutorial and see if it works for you.  Try all of the
examples.  If you run into any trouble, go to one of these other
books for that part or look for some videos on Youtube on the specific
topic.  Then go back and carry on with the tutorial.</p>

<h2>What About Java?</h2>

<p>And what about Java as a first language?  Well, here&rsquo;s the traditional
first program that prints out &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo; in Java:</p>

<pre><code>public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compare the same program in Python.</p>

<pre><code>print "Hello, World!"
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I understand why the Java program looks they way it does and
there are valid reasons for it&rsquo;s verbosity and what&rsquo;s going on there.
However, I&rsquo;ve used Python in many large programs and haven&rsquo;t missed
the features of Java even once (knock on wood).  I will admit, though,
that I&rsquo;m strangely drawn to Java. I remember when it first came on the
scene. I don&rsquo;t dislike it.  I&rsquo;ve just never found a use for it other
than interacting with systems or services that only support Java.</p>

<p>Google is now making available to all users, albeit by invitation only
for now, Inbox, it&rsquo;s new Gmail app.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve barely seen it but initially I&rsquo;m a bit skeptical.  There&rsquo;s a
focus on automatically bundling  your email for you and managing todo
lists.  I already manage my email with a strong and extensive set of
filters and I manage todo lists and things like that via my
implementation of David Allen&rsquo;s GTD.  So I&rsquo;m probably not an intended
user.</p>

<p>It will probably look compelling.  One thing I do like are email-like
systems where the messages look more like short messages in a chat
session rather than email.  When I think about this as a good idea
and then look back at Gmail, it really already goes a long way in that
direction.  The messages in a conversation are nicely minimal.</p>

<p>Inbox also seems to have a little floating circle, in this case a red
dot. This little floating circle, that is both highly annoying and in
the way as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, seems to be a popular gimmick lately.
Witness the little chat circle in Facebook&rsquo;s mobile apps.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m being highly critical of software I&rsquo;ve never even seen, so I may
be wrong about Inbox.  I do like the idea of an even nicer and somehow
simpler email application but I want full control over what&rsquo;s
happening.  And I don&rsquo;t need a new Gmail.  It&rsquo;s actually nearly
perfect already.  I fear that ongoing attempts to move it forward will
begin to degrade what I like about Gmail.</p>

<p>Lee Gomes writes in Slate The autonomous Google car may never actually
happen.</p>

<blockquote><p>For starters, the Google car was able to do so much more than its
predecessors in large part because the company had the resources to do
something no other robotic car research project ever could:  develop
an ingenious but extremely expensive mapping system.  These maps
contain the exact three-dimensional location of streetlights, stop
signs, crosswalks, lane markings, and every other crucial aspect of a
roadway.</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip;the maps necessary for the Google car are an order of magnitude
more complicated [than Google Maps].</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>To create them, a dedicated vehicle outfitted with a bank of sensors
first makes repeated passes scanning the roadway to be mapped.  The
data is <em>[sic]</em> then downloaded, with every square foot of the
landscape pored over by both humans and computers to make sure that
all-important real-world objects have been captured.  This complete
map gets loaded into the car&rsquo;s memory before a journey, and because
it knows from the map about the location of many stationary objects,
it&rsquo;s computer&mdash;essentially a generic PC running Ubuntu Linux&mdash;can
devote more of its energies to tracking moving objects, like other
cars.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Concerning last night&rsquo;s fireball in the southern sky&hellip;
There was a very bright fireball over middle Tennessee last night
(October 20) at 7:57:09 PM CT. Four NASA all sky cameras (located in
Tullahoma, Huntsville, Chickamauga, and North Georgia College) first
detected it at an altitude of 54 miles, moving slightly north of west
at 47,000 miles per hour.The meteor, estimated to weigh around 10
pounds, travelled some 64 miles through the atmosphere before
fragmenting 24 miles above the town of Brentwood, south of
Nashville. At its brightest, the fireball rivaled the first quarter
Moon, gathering a fair amount of attention in the tri-state area.</p>

<p>Wow!  There&rsquo;s a very large sunspot cluster visible to the naked eye
right now. Using a safe solar viewing apparatus, you can see it
without magnification.  I&rsquo;ve only seen these a handful of of times in
my life.</p>

<p>There seems to be quite a controversy brewing over systemd.  I was
reading the debianfork.org site this morning and also the Wikipedia
page.  It seems to be a case of the old UNIX-way vs. a new,
re-engineered way of the functionality of the <em>init(8)</em>
process/program and how system booting and startup are managed.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t dug into this enough yet to understand all of the details of
the arguments.  The Wikipedia page makes it look like people with
names I know were, at least initially, agin it.</p>

<p>I currently favor the Linux 12.04 Server edition and I&rsquo;ll probably be
looking to upgrade to 16.04 at some point.  Will I be looking at some
alternative, new fork of Linux by then?  Or will I even be looking at
Linux at all?  That&rsquo;s a good question.  I may have two or three Mac
Minis by then and that will be it.  It could happen.  System
administration eventually gets old.</p>

<p>Mark Shuttleworth, the chief of Ubuntu, stamped the Debian decision on
2014-02-14 to go forward with Systemd.  I&rsquo;m not encouraged that his
post title begins with the word &ldquo;losing.&rdquo;</p>

    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/18/the-great-divide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//postimages/dark_site_map.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 8</a></p>

<p>Recently some article about an upcoming astronomical event, I don&rsquo;t
recall which one, referred to the web site
<a href="http://darksitefinder.com/">darksitefinder.com</a> and the typical light
pollution maps there.  The maps illustrate the light being emitted
from the earth, mostly man-made, light that is strongly reflected back
from the atmosphere that illuminates the night sky, obscuring the view
of distant, astronomical objects.  But I noticed something that hadn&rsquo;t
caught my eye before.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>There was a very distinct line separating densely populated areas from
the eastern continental United States from the west.  Sure, I know the
West is more sparsely populated, at least until you get to the West
Coast, but I didn&rsquo;t know the dividing line dropped off so sharply.
The illumination levels correlate pretty well with population so this
is population density we&rsquo;re seeing here in nearly all cases.</p>

<p>The drop off edge doesn&rsquo;t quite match anything I can think of.  It&rsquo;s
not aligned with the Mississippi or any river really, or other
geologic feature, or a shift in climate or moisture.  There are cases
of all of those near the line but they don&rsquo;t quite match.  Some don&rsquo;t
match by a long shot.  I wondered if it might be a major north-south
railway that the last wall of cities there lies along.  That might be
but then you&rsquo;d still have to ask why the railroad ran along that
line.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no historical boundary that corresponds either, that I&rsquo;ve been
able to find so far.</p>

<p>There must be something going on here.  Some global characteristic of
the continental U.S. that&rsquo;s larger than the growth and development of
little independent population centers.  A sharp line like that doesn&rsquo;t
imply independence.  (To be clear, I mean in the mathematical, process
sense).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//postimages/darksite_close.png"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also fascinated by the rectangle of cities that Atlanta lies
in. The shape of Atlanta&rsquo;s light blob reveals the three fingers of
growth to the north along the I-75, Georgia 400, and I-85 corridors.</p>

<p>The bottom side of the rectangle is Montgomery, Columbus, Macon, and
Augusta.  The top side is Huntsville, Chattanooga, and Asheville.
Huntsville, Birmingham, and Montgomery make the west edge.  Asheville,
Greenville-Spartanburg, and Augusta make the east edge.</p>

<p>Knoxville is almost part of the northern edge but is stretched up
north, because it follows I-75 I think.</p>

<p>The population flow from Atlanta to Greenville-Spartanburg, Charlotte,
Greensboro, and Raleigh-Durham is fairly prominent.</p>

<p>You can also see the dark skies (the blue area) of Eastern Georgia
between Atlanta and Augusta.  That&rsquo;s the location both of Georgia
State&rsquo;s Hard Labor Creek observatory and the Deer Lick Astronomy
Village.  In sad contrast, notice how little dark sky is left in the
North Georgia Mountains north of Atlanta.</p>
