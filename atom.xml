<blockquote><p>Whether and when NASA&rsquo;s Voyager 1 spacecraft, humankind&rsquo;s most distant
object, broke through to interstellar space, the space between stars,
has been a thorny issue. For the last year, claims have surfaced every
few months that Voyager 1 has &ldquo;left our solar system.&rdquo; Why has the
Voyager team held off from saying the craft reached interstellar space
until now?</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Then on April 9, 2013, it happened: Voyager 1&rsquo;s plasma wave instrument
picked up local plasma oscillations. Scientists think they probably
stemmed from a burst of solar activity from a year before, a burst
that has become known as the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Solar Storms. The
oscillations increased in pitch through May 22 and indicated that
Voyager was moving into an increasingly dense region of plasma. This
plasma had the signatures of interstellar plasma, with a density more
than 40 times that observed by Voyager 2 in the heliosheath.</p>

<p>Gurnett and Kurth began going through the recent data and found a
fainter, lower-frequency set of oscillations from Oct. 23 to Nov. 27,
2012. When they extrapolated back, they deduced that Voyager had first
encountered this dense interstellar plasma in August 2012, consistent
with the sharp boundaries in the charged particle and magnetic field
data on August 25.</p>

<p>Stone called three meetings of the Voyager team. They had to decide
how to define the boundary between our solar bubble and interstellar
space and how to interpret all the data Voyager 1 had been sending
back. There was general agreement Voyager 1 was seeing interstellar
plasma, based on the results from Gurnett and Kurth, but the sun still
had influence. One persisting sign of solar influence, for example,
was the detection of outside particles hitting Voyager from some
directions more than others. In interstellar space, these particles
would be expected to hit Voyager uniformly from all directions.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//postimages/voyger_pia17046-640.jpg"></p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the end, there was general agreement that Voyager 1 was indeed
outside in interstellar space,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;But that location comes
with some disclaimers &ndash; we&rsquo;re in a mixed, transitional region of
interstellar space. We don&rsquo;t know when we&rsquo;ll reach interstellar space
free from the influence of our solar bubble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, would the team say Voyager 1 has left the solar system? Not
exactly &ndash; and that&rsquo;s part of the confusion. Since the 1960s, most
scientists have defined our solar system as going out to the Oort
Cloud, where the comets that swing by our sun on long timescales
originate. That area is where the gravity of other stars begins to
dominate that of the sun. It will take about 300 years for Voyager 1
to reach the inner edge of the Oort Cloud and possibly about 30,000
years to fly beyond it. Informally, of course, &ldquo;solar system&rdquo;
typically means the planetary neighborhood around our sun. Because of
this ambiguity, the Voyager team has lately favored talking about
interstellar space, which is specifically the space between each
star&rsquo;s realm of plasma influence.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>[This is a re-post of a blog post I first wrote and posted in
 2010-11-12 in <a href="http://monolith149daily.blogspot.com/2010/11/thirty-years-since-we-watched-voyager.html">Monolith149 Daily</a>.
 I&rsquo;ve made some slight edits to the text.]</em></p>

<p>I was the director of the planetarium at the time and had received a
letter from NASA that they were broadcasting live coverage of the
Voyager 1 encounter via satellite.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>When I was a kid, reading library books about the solar system, there
would often be a chapter at the end of the book on the Grand Tour of
the Planets.  A favorable alignment of the four gas giants, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, would allow a single spacecraft to visit
each of them using gravitational assist, in the distant future of the
1980s.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 1977, either 5 Sep 1977 (Voyager 2) or 20 Aug 1977
(Voyager 1), I forget which.* It&rsquo;s morning and I&rsquo;m lying on the sofa
after being at the museum&rsquo;s observatory all night.  I&rsquo;m watching the
Voyager spacecraft launch on TV.  With those launches, the Grand Tour
became a reality and Voyager 2 visited all four planets.</p>

<p>However, it was Voyager 1 that visited Jupiter and Saturn first.  The
spacecraft stole some of Jupiter&rsquo;s orbital momentum, causing Jupiter
to fall just a little bit toward the sun, as it accelerated on to
Saturn</p>

<p>The event was going to happen on 12 Nov 1980.  There was no NASA
channel at the time so I had to call the local cable operator (Cox)
and ask them to tune into the particular satellite and transponder
that NASA had arranged and to feed the coverage out over a spare
channel on their cable plant.  It took some convincing since they were
reluctant to actually commit a channel, even for a one-time event.  In
the end, I think I ended up talking to a guy in a control shack,
probably running their dish farm, who impressed me as not wanting to
be bothered with events from other planets.  My memory is that I never
got an absolute firm commitment but something more like a shaky okay
which was more than a little worrisome.</p>

<p>Next, it was necessary to find a video tape recorder and it turned out
there was one I could borrow from the board of education.  I drove
down to their dusty equipment warehouse to pick it up.  Or maybe it
was just the road by the warehouse that was dusty.  It was an old
&frac34;-inch U-Matic machine, a video cassette size frequently used
by TV stations in those days.  The &frac12;-in cassettes were just starting
to become popular as the VHS vs. Betamax battle was raging.</p>

<p>We hauled the recorder over to the house of one of our staff members&#8217;
parents to record the coverage since they had cable.  The encounter
was in the middle of the day and several of the planetarium staff were
crowded into their den, watching the show.</p>

<p>It was a heady time indeed as we watched those black and white
pictures scroll slowly in because the data download rates from the
space probe were slower than the modems of the time.  Of course they
were not digitally post-processed yet&mdash;they were pretty raw
images&mdash;so there were just the beginning hints of some of the amazing
sites to come.  The coverage cameras showed ecstatic scientists
watching the same images appear on their control room monitors and
there were several interviews with Ed Stone, Carl Sagan and others who
were seeing their own life-long fantasies come true.</p>

<p>Sometimes you suddenly arrive at those moments when you get goosebumps
and a lump in your throat, when you know you&rsquo;re experiencing pinnacle
achievements in human history.  This was one of them.</p>

<p>As the pictures crawled in, I believe it was possible, even in those
first images, to see the spokes in the rings, the braided F-ring, and
some of the other jaw-dropping, never-imagined features of Saturn
up-close.</p>

<p>After recording the fly-by, we borrowed a TV from one of the local TV
shops.  It was just a standard 19-in, or slightly larger, CRT.  We set
it up in the planetarium and opened to the public for a replay of the
&ldquo;live&rdquo; Voyager-Saturn encounter.  I remember we had a bit of
difficulty because the video tape recorder had a separate RF
modulator, the size of a small, chunky game cartridge, that had to be
physically plugged into the back of the machine before we could get a
signal to the TV.</p>

<p>I guess we had enough lead time to advertise the event using the usual
TV and newspaper avenues because there was a pretty good turnout.
There were college professors, amateur astronomers and many other
enthusiastic folks from the community who were just as thrilled
as the crew at JPL to see these first images coming back from the
ringed planet, even though our replay was delayed by hours.</p>

<p>As I recall there were encounter events over two or three days as
Voyager flew by some of Saturn&rsquo;s moons and made its way across
Saturn&rsquo;s &ldquo;miniature solar system,&rdquo; so we had probably two and possibly
three nights of replay.</p>

<p>Today Voyager 1 is over 115 AU (astronomical units) from the Sun.  By
definition, the Earth is 1 AU from the Sun.  Pluto is, on average, about 40
AU distant.  Voyager 1 is the most distant, active spacecraft in the solar
system and it&rsquo;s still collecting and transmitting data.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In four to six years, Voyager 1 is expected to cross beyond the
heliosheath, the outer layer of the bubble around our solar system
that is composed of ionized atoms streaming outward from our sun,&rdquo;
reports a news release from NASA this past October [2010].</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve come a long way from those solar system books from the library,
written in days when artists never even thought to include clouds when
illustrating the Earth as seen from space.  I&rsquo;ve been amazed to see so
many of those funny but always awe-inspiring artist&rsquo;s conceptions come
to reality.  It will be fascinating to see which ones come next.</p>

<p align="center">
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
</p>


<p>It was just past the turn of the century and I&rsquo;d never thought about
it before even after a couple of years or so.  It was a friend who
pointed out to me that the two vehicles sitting in our driveway were a
Voyager and a Saturn.</p>

<p>__________<br>
* No that&rsquo;s not a typo.  Due to the solar system and mission mechanics
involved, Voyager 2 was actually launched before Voyager 1.</p>

<p><em>Ghostly Spokes in the Rings</em></p>

<p><em>Scientists first saw these somewhat wedge-shaped, transient clouds of tiny particles known as “spokes” in images from NASA&rsquo;s Voyager spacecraft. They dubbed these features in Saturn&rsquo;s B ring “spokes” because they looked like bicycle spokes. An electrostatic charge, the way static electricity on Earth can raise the hair on your arms, appears to be levitating tiny ring particles above the ring plane, but scientists are still figuring out how the particles get that charge as they analyze images from NASA&rsquo;s Cassini spacecraft.</em></p>

image on the right was obtained by Cassini on Nov. 2, 2008.</em></p>

reliable weather information for agricultural and environmental
applications. Each station monitors air temperature, relative
humidity, rainfall, solar radiation, wind speed, wind direction, soil
temperature at 2, 4, and 8 inch depths, atmospheric pressure, and soil
moisture every 1 second. Data are summarized at 15 minute intervals
and at midnight a daily summary is calculated. A microcomputer at the
Georgia Experiment Station initiates telephone calls to each station
periodically and downloads the recorded data. The data are processed
immediately and disseminated via the world wide web.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.space.com/22635-american-minotaur-5-rocket-launch-debut.html">New American Rocket Making Launch Debut with Friday Moon Shot</a>
By Mike Wall, Senior Writer at Space.com</p>

<blockquote><p>A Minotaur V rocket will carry NASA&rsquo;s Lunar Atmosphere and Dust
Environment Explorer spacecraft (LADEE) on its maiden launch, which is
slated to take place Friday at 11:27 p.m. EDT (0327 GMT) from the
space agency&rsquo;s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.</p>

<p>The first three stages of the Minotaur V (and the Minotaur IV) are
solid rocket motors recycled from decommissioned Peacekeeper
intercontinental ballistic missiles. The fourth and fifth stages are
commercial Star motors, which are also flight-proven, [<em>Wallops
launch manager Doug</em>] Voss said.</p>

<p>The $280 million LADEE mission aims to study lunar dust and the moon&rsquo;s
wispy atmosphere from orbit using three science instruments.</p>

<p>[Space.com] Editor&rsquo;s note: Weather permitting, Friday&rsquo;s launch
 could be visible across wide regions of the U.S. East Coast.</p></blockquote>

<h2>What is LADEE</h2>

<p>From NASA:</p>

<blockquote><p>NASA&rsquo;s Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is a
robotic mission that will orbit the moon to gather detailed
information about the lunar atmosphere, conditions near the surface
and environmental influences on lunar dust. A thorough understanding
of these characteristics will address long-standing unknowns, and help
scientists understand other planetary bodies as well.</p>

<p>The LADEE spacecraft&rsquo;s modular common spacecraft bus, or body, is an
innovative way of transitioning away from custom designs and toward
multi-use designs and assembly-line production, which could
drastically reduce the cost of spacecraft development, just as the
Ford Model T did for automobiles. NASA&rsquo;s Ames Research Center
designed, developed, built and tested the spacecraft.</p></blockquote>

<p>I heard Clayton Morris on this weekend&rsquo;s
<a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-tech/419">TWIT</a> about the poll
question &ldquo;What are your top five phone apps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was wondering about my answer.  Well, let me take out my phone and
have a look.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll assume the calling app (the little phone handset) doesn&rsquo;t count.
I&rsquo;m not sure about the Clock app counts either.  If it did, it would
be near the top, too.</p>

<p>Trying to sort some of the apps on my home screens by most used, I
come up with.</p>

<ol>
<li>Clock</li>
<li>Text msg</li>
<li>Chrome browser</li>
<li>Weather/News Gadget</li>
<li>Gmail</li>
<li>Dogg Catcher</li>
<li>RadarScope</li>
<li>Youtube</li>
<li>Google Maps</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Amazon MP3 Player</li>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>Gallery</li>
<li>Phone call</li>
</ol>


<p>If I remove what came on the pure Google Android OS (Currently 4.2.2),
and focus on the apps I downloaded from the app store, then that
leaves the following.</p>

<ol>
<li>RadarScope</li>
<li>Dogg Catcher</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Email Me</li>
<li>Amazon MP3 Player</li>
</ol>


<p>Runners up which <em>might</em> actually belong on this list, but I&rsquo;m not
really sure which I truly use the most over others.  I use them all
quite a bit.</p>

<ul>
<li>Instapaper</li>
<li>Kindle Reader</li>
<li>AK Notepad</li>
<li>RPN Calculator</li>
<li>Grocery IQ</li>
<li>Plants vs. Zombies</li>
<li>Search Light</li>
<li>Roku Remote</li>
<li>Poly Clock</li>
<li>UTC Time</li>
</ul>

<p>From <a href="http://astrobob.areavoices.com/2013/08/14/new-bright-nova-erupts-in-delphinus-grab-your-binoculars/">Astro Bob</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Earlier today Japanese amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki photographed
a new bright nova in the constellation Delphinus (del-FYE-nuss). At
the time it was a little below the naked eye limit (6.8 magnitude) but
it’s since risen to around 6. That means observers with dark skies can
see our new guest without optical aid. And if you don’t have dark
skies, don’t worry. You’ll spot the star in any pair of binoculars.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Since showing itself on August 14, 2013, a bright nova in the
constellation Delphinus — now officially named Nova Delphini 2013 —
has brightened even more. As of this writing, the nova is at magnitude
4.4 to 4.5, meaning that for the first time in years, there is a nova
visible to the naked eye — if you have a dark enough sky. Even better,
use binoculars or a telescope to see this “new star” in the sky.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A less-awkward usage occurred to me yesterday for the KF notation.
Instead of referring to four gigbytes (4 GB) as &ldquo;4 3-KF&rdquo; use &ldquo;4 KF3&rdquo;.
So the scheme becomes KB = KF1, MG = KF2, GB = KF3, TB = KF4, PB = KF5,
and so on.</p>

<p>Early microcomputers had a maximum memory of 64 KF1.  The early IBM PC
architecture had 640 KF1 of useable memory when there was 1 KF2 of
RAM.</p>

<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been that long ago that 512 KF2 or even 640 KF2 were common
in modern PCs.  Today several KF3 are common and 10 or 20 KF3 in big
servers.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s not uncommon for a home user to have one or several KF4 of
disk space.</p>

<p>Corporate data stores can easily span several KF5 and get into the
KF6.  Reports of data resources in the KF7 realm are starting to surface..</p>

<p>Mike Elgan posts (on G+) &ldquo;Google+ is one of the 15 best blogging
platforms, according to <em>The Next Web</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>LOL!  What&rsquo;s funny about this statement is that I can&rsquo;t even think of
five blogging plaforms.  At least that are still relevant, e.g.,
leaving out Movable Type (which I really enjoyed) and LiveJournal.</p>

<p>Further, after looking at the article on <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/08/16/best-blogging-services/">The Next Web</a>, I
think the above headline overstates their case.</p>

<p>Usually when you see a blue nebula in an image, it&rsquo;s a reflection
nebula where primarily dust is reflecting star light.  In this case
NGC 2020 is apparently an emission nebula with ionized hydrogen
causing most of the blue glow.</p>

<blockquote><p>The pink-tinged cloud on the right, NGC 2014, is a glowing cloud of
mostly hydrogen gas. It contains a cluster of hot young stars. The
energetic radiation from these new stars strips electrons from the
atoms within the surrounding hydrogen gas, ionising it and producing a
characteristic red glow.</p>

<p>In addition to this strong radiation, massive young stars also produce
powerful stellar winds that eventually cause the gas around them to
disperse and stream away. To the left of the main cluster, a single
brilliant and very hot star [2] seems to have started this process,
creating a cavity that appears encircled by a bubble-like structure
called NGC 2020. The distinctive blueish colour of this rather
mysterious object is again created by radiation from the hot star —
this time by ionising oxygen instead of hydrogen.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//postimages/Opera-icon-high-res.png"></p>

<p>Chrome has gotten so slow and uses so much memory.  I downloaded the
lastest Opera this morning and tried it on Gmail and Picasaweb.  It
was much faster and left a lot more free memory!  When composing a
message in Gmail I didn&rsquo;t notice any loss of functionality.</p>

<p>Chrome was so fast and a joy to use when it was new.  What has
happened to Chrome?  And why?</p>

<p>[<em>Update Sat 2013-08-17 05:19:34 -0400: Just to be clear, I haven&rsquo;t
actually switched to using Opera.  I still use Chrome as my primary
browser. However, as a minimalist, I like simple, clean and fast.
I&rsquo;ll give Chrome a &ldquo;clean,&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s simple or fast
now.</em>]</p>

    <updated>2013-07-13T12:28:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2013/07/13/kf-notation-for-big-numbers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As storage grows exponentially, it&rsquo;s getting harder to keep up with
the specification of data capacity and other big numbers.  Even with
kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), terabytes (TB), etc., by the time we
get to petabytes (PB), exabytes (EB), zettabytes (ZB), and yottabytes
(YB), we&rsquo;ve long lost any sense of relative size.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m proposing a notation called K-Factor (KF), which is a size
converted to base-1024, i.e., it represents how
many factors of 1024, factors of K, are multiplied together.  The
K-Factor of a value is just the integer part of it&rsquo;s log-base-1024
value.  It&rsquo;s easier than it sounds.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//postimages/kf_table.png" title="" ></p>

<p>With such a notation in hand, we can cruise on beyond to 9 KF, 10 KF,
etc.</p>

<p>Using KF, you might specify a 2-TB disk as a  2-4KF disk and 4 GB of
RAM as 4 3KF.  Storage space of 16 petabytes would be 16 5KF.</p>

<p>As usual, one would have to recall that a <em>difference</em> between two
sizes of 1 KF would mean a factor of 1024 larger, a difference of 2 KF
would be roughly a factor of a million (1024<sup>2</sup>), 3 KF approximately a
billion, etc.</p>

<p>I have yet to find a similar scheme in the searching I&rsquo;ve done so far.</p>

by Shannon Hall</p>

<p>Kitt Peak used to be the premier US observatory.  Even though there
are much larger telescopes and sites now, yet it remains an impressive
place.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is my third trip to Kitt Peak, but my first chance to observe
on the Mayall 4-meter telescope. The first thing to know about the
4-meter is that it is a colossal maze. Literally.  There are 16
stories of rooms, now obsolete and out of date, before reaching the
base of the telescope itself.</p></blockquote>

<p>David Dickinson does an excellent job of explaining the so-called
super moon along with a nice bit of lunar orbital mechanics and
effects.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that it&rsquo;s not that big a deal.  You probably can&rsquo;t
tell the difference by looking at the moon.  The weather and other
local conditions, along with whether the moon is rising or high in the
sky, have a much greater effect on what you see.</p>

<p>The news buzz of the &ldquo;super moon&rdquo; also causes more people to stop
and take a moment to look at the moon.  Then they notice, &ldquo;Wow!  That
thing really is big and bright in the sky!&rdquo;  That&rsquo;s a nice thing that
astronomers generally just to more often anyway.</p>
