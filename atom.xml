    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 18.1</a></p>

<p>I just set up Inbox on a very old, in fact my oldest, earliest, Gmail
account.  Come to think of it, I guess that&rsquo;s appropriate in a way.
Here, briefly, are my very first impressions.</p>

<h2>Short Version</h2>

<p>Inbox is like the dead mouse your cat brings to you.  Thanks but
that&rsquo;s not exactly what I wanted and it&rsquo;s not quite useful to me,
though I appreciate the work you&rsquo;ve done.  I may even be impressed by
it.  It&rsquo;s true I could use something to eat right now, maybe even
something about that size, but that isn&rsquo;t it.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Slightly More Detail</h2>

<p>Minimalist email messages:  Yes.  I like this idea of messages that
can look like tweets but still, maybe, have support for long messages.
Really, though, I think long messages should be a document that is
emailed.</p>

<p>The card thing:  Bah.  I don&rsquo;t use Google Now and I don&rsquo;t want that
much help.</p>

<p>The todo list thing: Thumbs down.  I&rsquo;m in the fifth year of my
highly-evolved GTD system and I don&rsquo;t want help with this from my email
program.  I don&rsquo;t mind it being there, it looks like it would be a
great help for folks that <em>do</em> use email to manage their lives (what a
horrible, horrible concept, though).  There needs to be some way to
get all of those green check marks and todo-listness out of the email if you
don&rsquo;t want to see it there.  Where&rsquo;s the OFF switch??</p>

<p>The automatic grouping thing: Thumbs down again.  Similar to the
above, I&rsquo;ve had complete control of my email with filters and labels
for years.  I don&rsquo;t need help.  Please get your ideas of labels and
filters out of my email!</p>

<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s not really minimal.  Inbox looks minimal and simpler,
but really it sneaks in all of the above cruft.  A program that sort
of looked like Inbox, more minimalist than Gmail, but that didn&rsquo;t
impose a lot of complexity and stuff in return would be worth a closer
look.</p>

<p>I expect changes to Gmail itself along these lines and maybe then
there will be some settings switches (no doubt almost impossibly
buried) to turn some of these &ldquo;helpful&rdquo; features off.</p>

<p>And I should make clear that this is all from my personal point of
view.  For the vast masses, Inbox may be just what folks need so I&rsquo;m
not saying it shouldn&rsquo;t exist and may not be a huge hit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll find ways to keep playing with Inbox but it will be a while
before I unleash it on the actual Gmail that I use.</p>

<h2>P.S.</h2>

<p>It sure looks like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CICMxwgm274">Mailboxapp</a> introduced some two years ago.</p>

<p>I recently made a list of the program&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve written that I&rsquo;d consider
my favorites.  Then I made a list of the programming languages I had
used.  I think the result would qualify as a list of my favorite
programming languages.</p>

<ul>
<li>FORTRAN</li>
<li>BASIC</li>
<li>SNOBOL</li>
<li>Pascal</li>
<li>C</li>
<li>Objective-C</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>Python</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve written more code over the years in Perl and
Python.  I&rsquo;m not sure which would be in the lead at this point.</p>

<p>Two other languages, Smalltalk and LISP, are languages I really enjoy
but only in an occasional, recreational sense.  I&rsquo;ve never found either to be
useful for anything very practical.  However, it&rsquo;s a joy to write pure
object-oriented code in the wondrous Smalltalk-80-based environment of
Squeak.  Similarly, it&rsquo;s a thrill to write pure functional programs in
LISP, using Racket Scheme.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m half way to having blogged for 30 days straight.  It&rsquo;s
required keeping up with it but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it so far.  The fact that
I&rsquo;ve thrown some re-tweets and link postings in there helps.  I like
the mid-length blogging ideas and those really fit my thinking.
Short, quick posts that say something you want to say are fine!</p>

<p>Some other takers of the 30 day challenge have been reflecting

<p>What&rsquo;s the best way to learn the Python programming language?  I think
the on-line tutorial at python.org is the fastest but it works best if
Python isn&rsquo;t your first language.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Backing Up</h2>

<p>I think Python is nearly the perfect language.  Okay, it&rsquo;s not really
perfect, but it&rsquo;s as close as any I can think of.  There are other
languages that might be better for some extreme, specialized cases
(which will not seem extreme or specialized to anyone who works on
them every day) such as very low-level system programming, programs
where performance is critical, maybe very large corporate software
systems (though I&rsquo;d claim Python still holds it&rsquo;s own here), as just a
few examples.</p>

<p>However, even in those instances, Python does okay.</p>

<p>There are languages for other ways of thinking about programming like
the functional languages Haskell, LISP, etc.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s great about Python is that it&rsquo;s short, clear, easy to write
once you get the hang of it, very easy to read, and it can handle
programs that range from short little scripts to very large, complex
systems.</p>

<h2>If You&rsquo;ve Programmed Before</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve written programs before, in any programming language, then
you&rsquo;ll probably be fine using the on-line tutorial for Python.  It&rsquo;s
free and on-line at Python&rsquo;s own website,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/">https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/</a>.</p>

<p>Start with chapter 1, then do 2-4.  Then skip to chapter 7 with more
input/output.  After than follow up with 5.  You can add the
additional chapters later, as you either need to or are interested.</p>

<h2>If You&rsquo;re a Beginner</h2>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve found any beginning books that I&rsquo;ve looked at and
thought, &ldquo;Yes!  That&rsquo;s the ideal Python book for a beginning
programmer.&rdquo;  I am completely convinced that Python is the best
language for learning to program since Pascal.</p>

<p>The book <em>Learn Python the Hard Way</em> Third Edition by Zed A. Shaw,
Addison-Wesley Professional, 2013, seems pretty good and complete, but
it seems slow and plodding to me.  That approach may be perfect for
you.  Pace is always relative.  The book is free on-line, available as
a PDF you can download, or you can buy the on-line version and get the
accompanying videos or buy the regular book.</p>

<p>There seem to be thousands of vidoes teaching you Python on Youtube.
As far as I&rsquo;ve looked, I&rsquo;ve not found one that I like.  There are many
that are okay, but none that I&rsquo;ve bothered to write the URL down for.</p>

<p>The book <em>Learning Python</em> Fifth Edition by Mark Lutz, O&#8217;Reilly Media,
2013 is 1600 pages! It&rsquo;s hard for me to understand how you could make
a book on Python that long and I have looked it over.  I&rsquo;m not saying
it&rsquo;s not a good book, it&rsquo;s apparently complete and I believe it
includes exercises and the new Python 3 version.  Still, wow!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a beginner, I think I&rsquo;d still say take a look at Python&rsquo;s
on-line tutorial and see if it works for you.  Try all of the
examples.  If you run into any trouble, go to one of these other
books for that part or look for some videos on Youtube on the specific
topic.  Then go back and carry on with the tutorial.</p>

<h2>What About Java?</h2>

<p>And what about Java as a first language?  Well, here&rsquo;s the traditional
first program that prints out &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo; in Java:</p>

<pre><code>public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compare the same program in Python.</p>

<pre><code>print "Hello, World!"
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I understand why the Java program looks they way it does and
there are valid reasons for it&rsquo;s verbosity and what&rsquo;s going on there.
However, I&rsquo;ve used Python in many large programs and haven&rsquo;t missed
the features of Java even once (knock on wood).  I will admit, though,
that I&rsquo;m strangely drawn to Java. I remember when it first came on the
scene. I don&rsquo;t dislike it.  I&rsquo;ve just never found a use for it other
than interacting with systems or services that only support Java.</p>

    <updated>2014-10-23T05:48:00-04:00</updated>

<p>Google is now making available to all users, albeit by invitation only
for now, Inbox, it&rsquo;s new Gmail app.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve barely seen it but initially I&rsquo;m a bit skeptical.  There&rsquo;s a
focus on automatically bundling  your email for you and managing todo
lists.  I already manage my email with a strong and extensive set of
filters and I manage todo lists and things like that via my
implementation of David Allen&rsquo;s GTD.  So I&rsquo;m probably not an intended
user.</p>

<p>It will probably look compelling.  One thing I do like are email-like
systems where the messages look more like short messages in a chat
session rather than email.  When I think about this as a good idea
and then look back at Gmail, it really already goes a long way in that
direction.  The messages in a conversation are nicely minimal.</p>

<p>Inbox also seems to have a little floating circle, in this case a red
dot. This little floating circle, that is both highly annoying and in
the way as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, seems to be a popular gimmick lately.
Witness the little chat circle in Facebook&rsquo;s mobile apps.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m being highly critical of software I&rsquo;ve never even seen, so I may
be wrong about Inbox.  I do like the idea of an even nicer and somehow
simpler email application but I want full control over what&rsquo;s
happening.  And I don&rsquo;t need a new Gmail.  It&rsquo;s actually nearly
perfect already.  I fear that ongoing attempts to move it forward will
begin to degrade what I like about Gmail.</p>

<p>Lee Gomes writes in Slate The autonomous Google car may never actually
happen.</p>

<blockquote><p>For starters, the Google car was able to do so much more than its
predecessors in large part because the company had the resources to do
something no other robotic car research project ever could:  develop
an ingenious but extremely expensive mapping system.  These maps
contain the exact three-dimensional location of streetlights, stop
signs, crosswalks, lane markings, and every other crucial aspect of a
roadway.</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip;the maps necessary for the Google car are an order of magnitude
more complicated [than Google Maps].</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>To create them, a dedicated vehicle outfitted with a bank of sensors
first makes repeated passes scanning the roadway to be mapped.  The
data is <em>[sic]</em> then downloaded, with every square foot of the
landscape pored over by both humans and computers to make sure that
all-important real-world objects have been captured.  This complete
map gets loaded into the car&rsquo;s memory before a journey, and because
it knows from the map about the location of many stationary objects,
it&rsquo;s computer&mdash;essentially a generic PC running Ubuntu Linux&mdash;can
devote more of its energies to tracking moving objects, like other
cars.</p></blockquote>

There was a very bright fireball over middle Tennessee last night
(October 20) at 7:57:09 PM CT. Four NASA all sky cameras (located in
Tullahoma, Huntsville, Chickamauga, and North Georgia College) first
detected it at an altitude of 54 miles, moving slightly north of west
at 47,000 miles per hour.The meteor, estimated to weigh around 10
pounds, travelled some 64 miles through the atmosphere before
fragmenting 24 miles above the town of Brentwood, south of
Nashville. At its brightest, the fireball rivaled the first quarter
Moon, gathering a fair amount of attention in the tri-state area.</p>

<p>There seems to be quite a controversy brewing over systemd.  I was
reading the debianfork.org site this morning and also the Wikipedia
page.  It seems to be a case of the old UNIX-way vs. a new,
re-engineered way of the functionality of the <em>init(8)</em>
process/program and how system booting and startup are managed.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t dug into this enough yet to understand all of the details of
the arguments.  The Wikipedia page makes it look like people with
names I know were, at least initially, agin it.</p>

<p>I currently favor the Linux 12.04 Server edition and I&rsquo;ll probably be
looking to upgrade to 16.04 at some point.  Will I be looking at some
alternative, new fork of Linux by then?  Or will I even be looking at
Linux at all?  That&rsquo;s a good question.  I may have two or three Mac
Minis by then and that will be it.  It could happen.  System
administration eventually gets old.</p>

<p>Mark Shuttleworth, the chief of Ubuntu, stamped the Debian decision on
2014-02-14 to go forward with Systemd.  I&rsquo;m not encouraged that his
post title begins with the word &ldquo;losing.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//postimages/dark_site_map.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 8</a></p>

<p>Recently some article about an upcoming astronomical event, I don&rsquo;t
recall which one, referred to the web site
<a href="http://darksitefinder.com/">darksitefinder.com</a> and the typical light
pollution maps there.  The maps illustrate the light being emitted
from the earth, mostly man-made, light that is strongly reflected back
from the atmosphere that illuminates the night sky, obscuring the view
of distant, astronomical objects.  But I noticed something that hadn&rsquo;t
caught my eye before.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>There was a very distinct line separating densely populated areas from
the eastern continental United States from the west.  Sure, I know the
West is more sparsely populated, at least until you get to the West
Coast, but I didn&rsquo;t know the dividing line dropped off so sharply.
The illumination levels correlate pretty well with population so this
is population density we&rsquo;re seeing here in nearly all cases.</p>

<p>The drop off edge doesn&rsquo;t quite match anything I can think of.  It&rsquo;s
not aligned with the Mississippi or any river really, or other
geologic feature, or a shift in climate or moisture.  There are cases
of all of those near the line but they don&rsquo;t quite match.  Some don&rsquo;t
match by a long shot.  I wondered if it might be a major north-south
railway that the last wall of cities there lies along.  That might be
but then you&rsquo;d still have to ask why the railroad ran along that
line.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no historical boundary that corresponds either, that I&rsquo;ve been
able to find so far.</p>

<p>There must be something going on here.  Some global characteristic of
the continental U.S. that&rsquo;s larger than the growth and development of
little independent population centers.  A sharp line like that doesn&rsquo;t
imply independence.  (To be clear, I mean in the mathematical, process
sense).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//postimages/darksite_close.png"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also fascinated by the rectangle of cities that Atlanta lies
in. The shape of Atlanta&rsquo;s light blob reveals the three fingers of
growth to the north along the I-75, Georgia 400, and I-85 corridors.</p>

<p>The bottom side of the rectangle is Montgomery, Columbus, Macon, and
Augusta.  The top side is Huntsville, Chattanooga, and Asheville.
Huntsville, Birmingham, and Montgomery make the west edge.  Asheville,
Greenville-Spartanburg, and Augusta make the east edge.</p>

<p>Knoxville is almost part of the northern edge but is stretched up
north, because it follows I-75 I think.</p>

<p>The population flow from Atlanta to Greenville-Spartanburg, Charlotte,
Greensboro, and Raleigh-Durham is fairly prominent.</p>

<p>You can also see the dark skies (the blue area) of Eastern Georgia
between Atlanta and Augusta.  That&rsquo;s the location both of Georgia
State&rsquo;s Hard Labor Creek observatory and the Deer Lick Astronomy
Village.  In sad contrast, notice how little dark sky is left in the
North Georgia Mountains north of Atlanta.</p>

<p>On Day 1 (the same Day 6 link above) I said I&rsquo;d write a script.  The
script is called <strong>blog_post.py</strong> and is, of course, in Python 2.7.
When I post a blog on Octopress it basically consists of these steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Run the <strong>new_post</strong> command to create a file.</li>
<li>Edit the file to write the post with Emacs, using the Markdown language.</li>
<li>Save the file.</li>
<li>Generate the blog with a <strong>generate</strong> command which updates the
entire static site meaning all of the HTML, CSS, image and other files
used to create the website.</li>
<li>Copy all of those files to a Github directory.</li>
<li>Add, commit and push the Github directory up to Github.</li>
</ol>


<p>The script currently handles the first three steps and all I have to
do is specify the title on the command line.  The remaining steps are
still manual but I plan to add an automatic version of them, or at
least a more-automated version, to the script.</p>

<p>For as much posting as I&rsquo;ve been doing lately, making it this much
more convenient is more important than normal.</p>

<p>Some of you might point out that much of this automation is already
built into Octopress.  I think the fact that I want to deviate from
the out-of-the-box functionality it provide means it&rsquo;s easier just to
write a program in Python I can maintain rather than learning how to
hack the Octopress system.</p>

<p>Speaking of Github, it&rsquo;s the third leg of my switch to Octopress and
Markdown.  It&rsquo;s turned out to be a great hosting solution.  It&rsquo;s free,
reliable, and performs well.  Uploading is super efficient, too, of
course.</p>

<p>Should you fear your flashlight?  There&rsquo;s been a story going around
about the security threat of flashlight apps on your phone.  How
seriously should you take this?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing particularly dangerous about flashlight apps however
there is a general danger to be cautious of when you install <em>any</em>
apps on your phone.  That&rsquo;s the real lesson to take away here.</p>

<p><em>Image credit: by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/blakespot/3030107334/">Blake Patterson</a> CC BY 2.0.</em></p>

<!-- More -->


<p></p>

<p>Snopes reports there was one app developer in 2013 that settled a
complaint with the Federal Trade Commission because the app was
collecting information to use for ad targeting.</p>

<h2>The Lesson</h2>

<p>You give apps various permissions to access various types of data and
devices on your phone when you install them.  You have to give the
permission&mdash;both iPhone and Android will ask you when you install a
new app, or I believe the iPhone will sometimes ask when the app wants
to do something, i.e., it wants to access your location data.</p>

<p>One problem is the access and questions tend to be an all-or-nothing
type of question.  If my weather radar app wants to report on my
current location, it wants to access the GPS.  An email app will want
to access all of my contacts information.</p>

<p>One that really annoys me are apps that want to access all of the
contacts information so they can &ldquo;find my friends&rdquo; on their service.
I always refuse those.</p>

<p>If an app wants to do one little thing, the only choice is to ask for
access to that whole part of your phone.  You can see the problem.  If
they divided access rights up into little slices, like &ldquo;access your
current GPS location but not your past location history&rdquo;, there&rsquo;d be
such a long list of permissions people would just ignore them.</p>

<p>But most of us just ignore them anyway.  By now, most people just
click &ldquo;Oh okay&rdquo; and carry on.</p>

<h2>Here&rsquo;s What I Do</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I only get apps from the app store!  (The App Store for the iPhone
and the Google play store for Android).</p></li>
<li><p>I try to get some indication of how reputable the app developer is.
Have 10,000 downloaded it or just 20?  Are the reviews good?  Have I
heard of the developer or company before?  (Usually not).  Do they
have other apps in the store or just this one?  Does their
description and web site look professional or like a school project?</p></li>
<li><p>When apps ask for permission, if there&rsquo;s a choice, i.e., the app can
be used with or without it, I try to understand why it wants that
permission before I grant it.  If it wants access to my contact list
I never grant it because it&rsquo;s not my business to give away <em>your</em>
name, phone number and email address.  I usually will grant GPS
access.  Camera or microphone access had better have something to do
with what that the app is for.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The Apple App Store has strict policies about what apps they accept
and there is a review process that each app goes through.  The Google
play store is also supposed to be constantly checking their apps
though they are reputedly not as strict on admitting apps, but
presumably check them for security concerns.</p>

<p>If enough people have downloaded and use an app, then it&rsquo;s more likely
that any mischief has been discovered and reported.</p>

<h2>The Important Caveat</h2>

<p>However, none of these steps are guarantees that you won&rsquo;t get malware
on your phone.  There are clever attackers who can get past all of the
above checks, at least for a while before they are discovered.  For
that reason I don&rsquo;t use any critically important apps on my phone like
banking, etc.  I just don&rsquo;t use a phone for those.  And I&rsquo;m very
cautious about what I log into from my phone even using the web.  I
favor using LTE instead of an unknown, public wifi service.</p>

<p>Fortunately most apps now use HTTPS, SSL for secure connections.</p>

<p>I also just don&rsquo;t install many apps.  I mean I just don&rsquo;t install
willy nilly every app I see, hear about or someone recommends.  It has
to be something I have an interest in or an actual use for.</p>

<h2>Balance</h2>

<p>In the end you&rsquo;re trying to strike a balance between convenience,
features, and function vs. security.  We could replace our front door
with a three-inch steel door and drag concrete Jersey barriers in
front of the house, but that would be too much security for too much
lost convenience.  Probably.</p>

<h2>Final P.S.</h2>

<p>The iPhone has it&rsquo;s own built-in flashlight since IOS 7 (drag up from
the bottom of the screen) so you can uninstall one if you have it.</p>
