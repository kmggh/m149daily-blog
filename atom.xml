<p>Google is now making available to all users, albeit by invitation only
for now, Inbox, it&rsquo;s new Gmail app.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve barely seen it but initially I&rsquo;m a bit skeptical.  There&rsquo;s a
focus on automatically bundling  your email for you and managing todo
lists.  I already manage my email with a strong and extensive set of
filters and I manage todo lists and things like that via my
implementation of David Allen&rsquo;s GTD.  So I&rsquo;m probably not an intended
user.</p>

<p>It will probably look compelling.  One thing I do like are email-like
systems where the messages look more like short messages in a chat
session rather than email.  When I think about this as a good idea
and then look back at Gmail, it really already goes a long way in that
direction.  The messages in a conversation are nicely minimal.</p>

<p>Inbox also seems to have a little floating circle, in this case a red
dot. This little floating circle, that is both highly annoying and in
the way as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, seems to be a popular gimmick lately.
Witness the little chat circle in Facebook&rsquo;s mobile apps.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m being highly critical of software I&rsquo;ve never even seen, so I may
be wrong about Inbox.  I do like the idea of an even nicer and somehow
simpler email application but I want full control over what&rsquo;s
happening.  And I don&rsquo;t need a new Gmail.  It&rsquo;s actually nearly
perfect already.  I fear that ongoing attempts to move it forward will
begin to degrade what I like about Gmail.</p>

<p>Lee Gomes writes in Slate The autonomous Google car may never actually
happen.</p>

<blockquote><p>For starters, the Google car was able to do so much more than its
predecessors in large part because the company had the resources to do
something no other robotic car research project ever could:  develop
an ingenious but extremely expensive mapping system.  These maps
contain the exact three-dimensional location of streetlights, stop
signs, crosswalks, lane markings, and every other crucial aspect of a
roadway.</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip;the maps necessary for the Google car are an order of magnitude
more complicated [than Google Maps].</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>To create them, a dedicated vehicle outfitted with a bank of sensors
first makes repeated passes scanning the roadway to be mapped.  The
data is <em>[sic]</em> then downloaded, with every square foot of the
landscape pored over by both humans and computers to make sure that
all-important real-world objects have been captured.  This complete
map gets loaded into the car&rsquo;s memory before a journey, and because
it knows from the map about the location of many stationary objects,
it&rsquo;s computer&mdash;essentially a generic PC running Ubuntu Linux&mdash;can
devote more of its energies to tracking moving objects, like other
cars.</p></blockquote>

<p>Concerning last night&rsquo;s fireball in the southern sky&hellip;
There was a very bright fireball over middle Tennessee last night
(October 20) at 7:57:09 PM CT. Four NASA all sky cameras (located in
Tullahoma, Huntsville, Chickamauga, and North Georgia College) first
detected it at an altitude of 54 miles, moving slightly north of west
at 47,000 miles per hour.The meteor, estimated to weigh around 10
pounds, travelled some 64 miles through the atmosphere before
fragmenting 24 miles above the town of Brentwood, south of
Nashville. At its brightest, the fireball rivaled the first quarter
Moon, gathering a fair amount of attention in the tri-state area.</p>

<p>Wow!  There&rsquo;s a very large sunspot cluster visible to the naked eye
right now. Using a safe solar viewing apparatus, you can see it
without magnification.  I&rsquo;ve only seen these a handful of of times in

<p>There seems to be quite a controversy brewing over systemd.  I was
reading the debianfork.org site this morning and also the Wikipedia
page.  It seems to be a case of the old UNIX-way vs. a new,
re-engineered way of the functionality of the <em>init(8)</em>
process/program and how system booting and startup are managed.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t dug into this enough yet to understand all of the details of
the arguments.  The Wikipedia page makes it look like people with
names I know were, at least initially, agin it.</p>

<p>I currently favor the Linux 12.04 Server edition and I&rsquo;ll probably be
looking to upgrade to 16.04 at some point.  Will I be looking at some
alternative, new fork of Linux by then?  Or will I even be looking at
Linux at all?  That&rsquo;s a good question.  I may have two or three Mac
Minis by then and that will be it.  It could happen.  System
administration eventually gets old.</p>

<p>Mark Shuttleworth, the chief of Ubuntu, stamped the Debian decision on
2014-02-14 to go forward with Systemd.  I&rsquo;m not encouraged that his
post title begins with the word &ldquo;losing.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//postimages/dark_site_map.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 8</a></p>

<p>Recently some article about an upcoming astronomical event, I don&rsquo;t
recall which one, referred to the web site
<a href="http://darksitefinder.com/">darksitefinder.com</a> and the typical light
pollution maps there.  The maps illustrate the light being emitted
from the earth, mostly man-made, light that is strongly reflected back
from the atmosphere that illuminates the night sky, obscuring the view
of distant, astronomical objects.  But I noticed something that hadn&rsquo;t
caught my eye before.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>There was a very distinct line separating densely populated areas from
the eastern continental United States from the west.  Sure, I know the
West is more sparsely populated, at least until you get to the West
Coast, but I didn&rsquo;t know the dividing line dropped off so sharply.
The illumination levels correlate pretty well with population so this
is population density we&rsquo;re seeing here in nearly all cases.</p>

<p>The drop off edge doesn&rsquo;t quite match anything I can think of.  It&rsquo;s
not aligned with the Mississippi or any river really, or other
geologic feature, or a shift in climate or moisture.  There are cases
of all of those near the line but they don&rsquo;t quite match.  Some don&rsquo;t
match by a long shot.  I wondered if it might be a major north-south
railway that the last wall of cities there lies along.  That might be
but then you&rsquo;d still have to ask why the railroad ran along that
line.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no historical boundary that corresponds either, that I&rsquo;ve been
able to find so far.</p>

<p>There must be something going on here.  Some global characteristic of
the continental U.S. that&rsquo;s larger than the growth and development of
little independent population centers.  A sharp line like that doesn&rsquo;t
imply independence.  (To be clear, I mean in the mathematical, process
sense).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//postimages/darksite_close.png"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also fascinated by the rectangle of cities that Atlanta lies
in. The shape of Atlanta&rsquo;s light blob reveals the three fingers of
growth to the north along the I-75, Georgia 400, and I-85 corridors.</p>

<p>The bottom side of the rectangle is Montgomery, Columbus, Macon, and
Augusta.  The top side is Huntsville, Chattanooga, and Asheville.
Huntsville, Birmingham, and Montgomery make the west edge.  Asheville,
Greenville-Spartanburg, and Augusta make the east edge.</p>

<p>Knoxville is almost part of the northern edge but is stretched up
north, because it follows I-75 I think.</p>

<p>The population flow from Atlanta to Greenville-Spartanburg, Charlotte,
Greensboro, and Raleigh-Durham is fairly prominent.</p>

<p>You can also see the dark skies (the blue area) of Eastern Georgia
between Atlanta and Augusta.  That&rsquo;s the location both of Georgia
State&rsquo;s Hard Labor Creek observatory and the Deer Lick Astronomy
Village.  In sad contrast, notice how little dark sky is left in the
North Georgia Mountains north of Atlanta.</p>

<p>On Day 1 (the same Day 6 link above) I said I&rsquo;d write a script.  The
script is called <strong>blog_post.py</strong> and is, of course, in Python 2.7.
When I post a blog on Octopress it basically consists of these steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Run the <strong>new_post</strong> command to create a file.</li>
<li>Edit the file to write the post with Emacs, using the Markdown language.</li>
<li>Save the file.</li>
<li>Generate the blog with a <strong>generate</strong> command which updates the
entire static site meaning all of the HTML, CSS, image and other files
used to create the website.</li>
<li>Copy all of those files to a Github directory.</li>
<li>Add, commit and push the Github directory up to Github.</li>
</ol>


<p>The script currently handles the first three steps and all I have to
do is specify the title on the command line.  The remaining steps are
still manual but I plan to add an automatic version of them, or at
least a more-automated version, to the script.</p>

<p>For as much posting as I&rsquo;ve been doing lately, making it this much
more convenient is more important than normal.</p>

<p>Some of you might point out that much of this automation is already
built into Octopress.  I think the fact that I want to deviate from
the out-of-the-box functionality it provide means it&rsquo;s easier just to
write a program in Python I can maintain rather than learning how to
hack the Octopress system.</p>

<p>Speaking of Github, it&rsquo;s the third leg of my switch to Octopress and
Markdown.  It&rsquo;s turned out to be a great hosting solution.  It&rsquo;s free,
reliable, and performs well.  Uploading is super efficient, too, of
course.</p>

<p>Should you fear your flashlight?  There&rsquo;s been a story going around
about the security threat of flashlight apps on your phone.  How
seriously should you take this?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing particularly dangerous about flashlight apps however
there is a general danger to be cautious of when you install <em>any</em>
apps on your phone.  That&rsquo;s the real lesson to take away here.</p>

<p>Snopes reports there was one app developer in 2013 that settled a
complaint with the Federal Trade Commission because the app was
collecting information to use for ad targeting.</p>

<h2>The Lesson</h2>

<p>You give apps various permissions to access various types of data and
devices on your phone when you install them.  You have to give the
permission&mdash;both iPhone and Android will ask you when you install a
new app, or I believe the iPhone will sometimes ask when the app wants
to do something, i.e., it wants to access your location data.</p>

<p>One problem is the access and questions tend to be an all-or-nothing
type of question.  If my weather radar app wants to report on my
current location, it wants to access the GPS.  An email app will want
to access all of my contacts information.</p>

<p>One that really annoys me are apps that want to access all of the
contacts information so they can &ldquo;find my friends&rdquo; on their service.
I always refuse those.</p>

<p>If an app wants to do one little thing, the only choice is to ask for
access to that whole part of your phone.  You can see the problem.  If
they divided access rights up into little slices, like &ldquo;access your
current GPS location but not your past location history&rdquo;, there&rsquo;d be
such a long list of permissions people would just ignore them.</p>

<p>But most of us just ignore them anyway.  By now, most people just
click &ldquo;Oh okay&rdquo; and carry on.</p>

<h2>Here&rsquo;s What I Do</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I only get apps from the app store!  (The App Store for the iPhone
and the Google play store for Android).</p></li>
<li><p>I try to get some indication of how reputable the app developer is.
Have 10,000 downloaded it or just 20?  Are the reviews good?  Have I
heard of the developer or company before?  (Usually not).  Do they
have other apps in the store or just this one?  Does their
description and web site look professional or like a school project?</p></li>
<li><p>When apps ask for permission, if there&rsquo;s a choice, i.e., the app can
be used with or without it, I try to understand why it wants that
permission before I grant it.  If it wants access to my contact list
I never grant it because it&rsquo;s not my business to give away <em>your</em>
name, phone number and email address.  I usually will grant GPS
access.  Camera or microphone access had better have something to do
with what that the app is for.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The Apple App Store has strict policies about what apps they accept
and there is a review process that each app goes through.  The Google
play store is also supposed to be constantly checking their apps
though they are reputedly not as strict on admitting apps, but
presumably check them for security concerns.</p>

<p>If enough people have downloaded and use an app, then it&rsquo;s more likely
that any mischief has been discovered and reported.</p>

<h2>The Important Caveat</h2>

<p>However, none of these steps are guarantees that you won&rsquo;t get malware
on your phone.  There are clever attackers who can get past all of the
above checks, at least for a while before they are discovered.  For
that reason I don&rsquo;t use any critically important apps on my phone like
banking, etc.  I just don&rsquo;t use a phone for those.  And I&rsquo;m very
cautious about what I log into from my phone even using the web.  I
favor using LTE instead of an unknown, public wifi service.</p>

<p>Fortunately most apps now use HTTPS, SSL for secure connections.</p>

<p>I also just don&rsquo;t install many apps.  I mean I just don&rsquo;t install
willy nilly every app I see, hear about or someone recommends.  It has
to be something I have an interest in or an actual use for.</p>

<h2>Balance</h2>

<p>In the end you&rsquo;re trying to strike a balance between convenience,
features, and function vs. security.  We could replace our front door
with a three-inch steel door and drag concrete Jersey barriers in
front of the house, but that would be too much security for too much
lost convenience.  Probably.</p>

<h2>Final P.S.</h2>

<p>The iPhone has it&rsquo;s own built-in flashlight since IOS 7 (drag up from
the bottom of the screen) so you can uninstall one if you have it.</p>

<p>Day 4</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Occasional reports on what in the world Iâ€™m doing. You can read here
to find out what Iâ€™ve been working on and how itâ€™s going. There might
be clues about what Iâ€™m thinking. New things learned will also appear.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really not going to make all of these posts about blogging, I
promise.  However, I thought I should note this blog is now in it&rsquo;s
12th year.  I always miss the anniversary but it was this past month.
The first post was on Mon 2002-09-16 00:29 -0400.</p>

<p>In the beginning the posts were nearly all work-related reports on
what I was working on.  Then I began to include other topics I found
interesting such as astronomy and computing.</p>

<p>The first posts were written on Blogger, then still owned by Pyra
Labs, co-founded by Ev Williams who later was a co-founder of Twitter.
Google eventually bought Blogger.  I wrote the posts on Blogger but used
it&rsquo;s ftp publishing feature to push the generated pages back to my
desktop workstation, Monolith.</p>

<p>Monolith had an Apache web server running on it, upgraded from the
original NCSA HTTP server software at some point.  The computer had
originally been a NeXTstation then later it&rsquo;s soul had been migrated
to a Sun SPARC 5 workstation.  By this time, when the blog began in
2002, I think it might have been upgraded to a Sun Ultra 5 but I don&rsquo;t
recall the models and timeline precisely.</p>

<p>From Blogger, I migrated to Bloxom, then back to Blogger, fully hosted
at Blogspot, then recently to Octopress.  The pre-Octopress blog is
still on-line.</p>

    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/13/spell-checking-with-gmail</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Day 3</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to make <em>all</em> of these posts about blogging but, while
still on the subject, here&rsquo;s a simple blogging tip.  I use Gmail for spell
checking.</p>

<p>The fact is that I do this just about any time I need good spell
checking.  Ironically, Google documents&#8217; spell checking is lacking so
I even use this approach for them. (At least that used to be the
case).</p>

<p>First, open a new message in a Compose window but don&rsquo;t add any
recipients.  After all, you don&rsquo;t want to accidentally send your text
to someone.  Next, just past the text, say a whole document into the
window and check.  As you find misspelled words, go back and edit the
original.  When finished, just click the trash can icon in the compose
window to discard the message.</p>

<p>For anyone who points out that Gmail spell checking isn&rsquo;t perfect
either, yeah, I know.  It&rsquo;s been the best I&rsquo;ve found over the years,
though.</p>

    <link href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/12/octopress-after-512-days/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-12T23:10:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/12/octopress-after-512-days</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Day 2</p>

<p>Well, I was supposed to report back in on how it&rsquo;s been going with
Octopress after using it a while.  It&rsquo;s now been 512 days, or one year
and 147 days, or about 17 months which is about one year and five
months.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s basically been going okay.  The process isn&rsquo;t bad.  I put up
posts now and then with varying frequency.  Some are &ldquo;full&rdquo; posts with
picture and permission, some are occasionally long, and some are
short, ~tweet-length updates.</p>

<p>I like Octopress a lot.  The best part is writing in Markdown which
means my source files are all plain text and I have a copy of all of
them, so the blog is already in my possession and easily read without
any software or publishing.</p>

<p>The Octopress scripts are easy to use.  Right now I run a new_post
command to create a file, edit the file with Emacs, then re-generate
the blog and finally push the changes up to Github which is where I
publish it.</p>

<p>Adding an image is hardly more difficult than it was with Blogger.  I
have to download the image and get it into the machine I&rsquo;m writing
on.  Then it&rsquo;s just copying the image to a source directory in the
blog tree and adding one line to the Markdown file.</p>

<p>Yesterday, on Saturday I wrote the beginning of a Python script to
automate running those commands.  So far it handles it all up to
running Emacs on the created file.  Next will come updating the git
repo locally then pushing up the changes.</p>

<p>The biggest down side at the moment is that the archives are organized
in the single page view by date and year, but they aren&rsquo;t physically
organized in the real file tree.  Also there&rsquo;s no way to segment the
blog into archive pieces.  Generate, I think, rebuilds the whole site
basically and, as the site grows, it&rsquo;s taking a while to do a generate
now.  Okay, it takes 25 seconds but it seems like a long while.</p>

<p>As the archive grows to be years long, I believe it will become a big
unweildy.  It would be better if there was a way to segment off pieces
of the archive, e.g., each year, so you don&rsquo;t end up regenerating it
all every time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually pretty sure there is a way to do this, I&rsquo;ll just have to
dig it up when there&rsquo;s time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Day 1</p>

<p>I heard it mentioned by Gina Trapani on <em>This Week in Google</em> on
Twit.tv.  There&rsquo;s a challenge going around to blog for 30 days
straight but not on weekends.  She credited it to Om Malik.  He
credited the idea to Matt Mullenweg and he credited it to a challenge
from Colin Devroe, ironically on Twitter.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve blogged off and on for over 12 years now and I&rsquo;ve really slacked
off lately so the thought of posting more has already been on my
mind.  I&rsquo;m already not following the challenge because, well, it&rsquo;s the
weekend. But I&rsquo;ll see what I can do for 30 days.</p>

<p>Just minutes ago, I sat down and almost instantly brainstormed about 20
topics that were already on my mind.  If there&rsquo;s nothing new on my
mind for a particular day I&rsquo;ll have those to fall back on.</p>

<p>The next thing I&rsquo;ll do, I think, is write a script.</p>
