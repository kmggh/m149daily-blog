<blockquote><p>The Kaguya (Selene) lunar orbiter, a Japanese spacecraft nicknamed
after a legendary moon princess, launched in 2007 carrying two
high-definition TV cameras, which it used to capture stunning video
and pictures of the lunar surface.</p>

<p>Although the mission ended in 2009, this week the Japanese space
agency released the entire haul of digital images captured by Kaguya
during its lifetime. Some of the images have never been seen before by
the public.</p></blockquote>

    <link href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2016/10/13/new-dwarf-planet-2014-uz224/"/>
    <updated>2016-10-13T05:54:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2016/10/13/new-dwarf-planet-2014-uz224</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new trans-Neptunian object 2014 UZ224 has been annouced by the
discoverers.  It&rsquo;s orbit has a semi-major axis of 109 AU with a
current distance of 93 AU in the scattered disc.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Calla Cofield reports in Space.com,</p>

<blockquote><p>The dwarf planet, called 2014 UZ224, measures about 330 miles (530
kilometers) across and is located about 8.5 billion miles (13.7
billion km) from the sun, NPR reported today (Oct. 11). For
comparison, Pluto&rsquo;s largest moon, Charon, is about 750 miles (1,200
km) in diameter, and reaches a maximum distance of about 4.5 billion
miles (7.3 billion km) from the sun.</p>

<p>A year on 2014 UZ224 (the time it takes the dwarf planet to orbit the
sun) is about 1,100 Earth years. One Pluto year &hellip; is about 248
Earth years.</p></blockquote>

<p>The object was discovered using the Dark Energy Camera.</p>

<blockquote><p>A project called the Dark Energy Survey is using observations from the
DECam to create a map of the universe that provides information
relevant to the study of dark energy. The DES maps have already been
used to study dark matter (which makes up about eighty percent of all
the mass in the universe but whose exact nature is still a mystery)
and to find previously unidentified objects.</p>

<p>Part of the DES includes taking images of a few small patches of the
sky &ldquo;roughly&rdquo; once per week, according to the mission website, and
that&rsquo;s what made this new discovery possible.</p></blockquote>

<p>The interesting part of this article tells how undergraduate students
made the discovery by analyzing data with software they wrote.</p>

<p>Once again there&rsquo;s a minor crisis in naming.</p>

<blockquote><p>The smallest object in the solar system that has earned the title of
&ldquo;dwarf planet&rdquo; (prior to this new discovery) is Ceres, which lies in
the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars. Ceres is 590 miles (950
km) across. The object 2014 UZ224 might be too small to be considered
a dwarf planet, Gerdes told NPR, but that will have to be decided by
the International Astronomical Union (which made the controversial
decision to demote Pluto to a dwarf planet). There are four other
recognized dwarf planets in the solar system, but scientists think
there could be dozens — or even more than 100 — objects that size that
have yet to be discovered, according to NASA.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Distances</h2>

<p>I like it&rsquo;s easiest to think of solar system distances in terms of
light travel time from the sun.  It takes sunlight about eight minutes
to reach the Earth from the Sun.  It&rsquo;s 43 minutes to Jupiter, over
five hours to Pluto on average, and 15 hours to UZ224.</p>

<p>The chart below is based on the semi-major axis of each orbit which
you can think of as the average of the maximum and minimum distances
from the Sun.</p>

<pre><code>Earth     1.0 AU =      8.3 min
Jupiter   5.2 AU =     43   min
Neptune  30   AU =   4h10m
Pluto    39   AU =   5h25m
UZ224   109   AU =  15h08m
</code></pre>

    <link href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2016/10/10/ios-10-upgrade/"/>
    <updated>2016-10-10T00:22:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2016/10/10/ios-10-upgrade</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s upgrade week for IOS.  I finally decided to take the plunge and
upgrade IOS 9 to IOS 10 on my iPhone 6S.  Usually I wait until about
the second minor update has come out and we&rsquo;re now at 10.0.2 as of
late last week, so Sunday night was the night.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Even though the initial problems with over-the-air upgrades was
solved, I&rsquo;m still sticking with using iTunes on my desktop Mac Mini to
do the upgrade.  I grabbed my charging cable, plugged the phone into
the computer, started up iTunes because it&rsquo;s configured not to start
automatically, and first went to do a back up.</p>

<h2>Backup and Download</h2>

<p>Starting at about 22:35, I did an encrypted backup which said it was
taking about 10 minutes but that last 10 seconds seemed to take an
additional five minutes or so.  The encrypted back up will grab the
key chains and such.</p>

<p>From there I clicked the button to proceed with the 10.0.2 install and
it began the download to my computer.  This was the most uncomfortable
part because there&rsquo;s no progress bar or anything to really indicate
it&rsquo;s working.  I was monitoring the network traffic with Activity
Monitor and could see the actual packet rates as it downloaded, but I
would have preferred to have more feedback.</p>

<p>The downloading seemed to finally finish at about 23:40.  I just
happened to look up and notice the message in iTunes that said it was
downloading had changed to click Upgrade to begin the upgrade.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>The upgrade was much quicker and the progress bars appeared on the
phone as usual.  After only about 14 minutes at 23:54 the phone went
dark for quite a few seconds.  Again I wondered if all was well but
the white reboot screen with the black apple finally appeared.  There
was another progress bar and then I was logging in with my pass code
on the phone at 23:56.</p>

<p>iTunes then popped up a box saying there was an upgrade from the
carrier so I clicked that button and it quickly and silently installed
with no indication that anything happened from the phone itself.</p>

<p>By about midnight I was done.  I fooled around with the phone for
another 15 minutes or so, moved the newly appeared Home app into a
folder, and it was done.</p>

<h2>Post Install</h2>

<p>I just looked at things briefly. The lock screen, swipe-up screen and
the notifications screen are all different.  The new buttons in
Messages were there but it was too late to try any of that.  Also the
wake-up, unlock process is different.  So far it&rsquo;s a little confusing
in the sense that I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s different.  You push the home
button to unlock the screen which is what I thought I used to do.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s anything else interesting enough to follow up on I&rsquo;ll
report back later.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brian Clark Howard at National Geographic writes that &ldquo;Our Part of the
Milky Way is Four Times Bigger Than We Thought.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- More -->


<blockquote><p>Published in the journal Science Advances this week, a new study
reported that our surrounding area of stars, gas, and dust—called the
Local Arm, Orion Spur, or Orion–Cygnus Arm—is actually about 20,000
light-years long.</p>

<p>The Local Arm is still considerably shorter than the Milky Way’s four
main arms, which wind around the galaxy&rsquo;s center for roughly 80,000
light-years. The total diameter of the galaxy is often reported as
about 100,000 light-years, although Reid says more recent evidence
suggests it is probably more like 70,000 light-years, at least to the
edge of where star density starts to really drop off.</p></blockquote>

<p>The abstract from the paper in &ldquo;Science Advances,&rdquo; &ldquo;The local spiral
structure of the Milky Way&rdquo; by Ye Xu, et al.</p>

<blockquote><p>The nature of the spiral structure of the Milky Way has long been
debated. Only in the last decade have astronomers been able to
accurately measure distances to a substantial number of high-mass
star-forming regions, the classic tracers of spiral structure in
galaxies. We report distance measurements at radio wavelengths using
the Very Long Baseline Array for eight regions of massive star
formation near the Local spiral arm of the Milky Way. Combined with
previous measurements, these observations reveal that the Local Arm is
larger than previously thought, and both its pitch angle and star
formation rate are comparable to those of the Galaxy’s major spiral
arms, such as Sagittarius and Perseus. Toward the constellation
Cygnus, sources in the Local Arm extend for a great distance along our
line of sight and roughly along the solar orbit. Because of this
orientation, these sources cluster both on the sky and in velocity to
form the complex and long enigmatic Cygnus X region. We also identify
a spur that branches between the Local and Sagittarius spiral arms.</p></blockquote>

accounts than you can count on one hand and I&rsquo;m getting a continuous
flood of email from them.  They are all filtered in various ways, in
Gmail, so they go into labels that are those I mostly don&rsquo;t read, but
the flood is still annoying.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Today, I finally logged into (almost) all of them and under Settings,
Email Notifications, I unclicked most of the blue boxes near the
bottom about network activity and suggestions and such.  I left
checked the boxes about letting me know if someone retweeted a tweet
(since that rarely happens except for one account I use as part of
work) or sent me a reply or direct message.  That should quiet down
the bird some.</p>

notifications, too.  I can put up a blog post or two and then send a brief
email message to a list of friends and family with the links.  This ia
actually a method of using sender-stored email where the blog post
becomes the sender-stored message and the notification is via the
email notice.</p>

<p>Beyond notifications, it&rsquo;s a way to stay in touch with an exact set of
family and friends which is otherwise hard to do.  That&rsquo;s because some
are on Facebook, some on Twitter, maybe even on Google+?  Nah,
probably not Google+.  Who knows, but I think email is still
universal.</p>

    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2016/10/01/its-email</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a reposting of a bit I wrote on Fri 2015-05-29.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gone round and round trying to sort out what&rsquo;s the ideal
communication solution.  For now I&rsquo;ve come back to the simple answer:
email.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>I thought email was over, that it was time to leave it behind,
relegated to just handling commercial spam and first-contact
messages.  However, in searching for some replacement that made sense,
that had a simpler storage architecture, HTTP-only transport, and so
forth, I haven&rsquo;t found a simple solution.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still true that sender-stored email is an ideal solution, but it
requires the <em>sender</em> to do the work.  It even works, at least when
<em>I&rsquo;m</em> the sender.  However, replies and conversations are a bit more
difficult with sender-stored email than with regular email.</p>

<p>The indie web and micro-formats are also interesting moves in this
direction, but they also represent a lot of work for the participant.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Gmail ends up being an implementation that has nearly all
of the properties of any of the replacements I can imagine,
particularly when all participants are actually on Gmail.  In that
case it is all secure HTTPS to the service, storage is secure and you
can get your data out if you want to leave Gmail.</p>

<ul>
<li>One to one is straightforward.</li>
<li>One to many is BCC.</li>
<li>Many to one is straightforward.</li>
</ul>


<p>And, it turns out that Gmail in it&rsquo;s native format is very
lightweight.  My recent move toward eliminating signing messages and
removing the signature makes it nearly identical to a simple chat.
Gmail&rsquo;s presentation keeps that view clean.</p>

<p>Gmail&rsquo;s Inbox moves a couple of steps closer to the clean and simple
ideal, but then it leaves other features hard to use.  Inbox
superimposes a todo list view on the email that&rsquo;s unwanted, with the
slight redeeming quality that it does provide a way to keep the inbox
looking clean and minimal.  My recent problem with Inbox, which I&rsquo;m
using for kenguyton@gmail.com, was that I had two unread messages that
I simply could not find on the phone app even though it had a badge
saying two items were there, somewhere!  Fortunately, going back to
Inbox on the desktop showed them right up top.  There seems to be some
bug in that system, maybe in the phone-desktop interaction.</p>

<p>So, for now, I&rsquo;m going back to basics.  Email.  I&rsquo;d never have
believed it.</p>

<p>That said, I do use phone text messaging, and more specifically,
iMessage on the iPhone, for the majority of my family communication.
I use Facebook messages and Facebook for some.  I&rsquo;ve never done more
than play with direct messages on Twitter.  We use Hipchat at work
which I dislike a lot.  That model is wrong in several ways. My
biggest complaint there is that Messages aren&rsquo;t threaded.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the most recent image of my iPhone home screen as it continues
to evolve.  I think the most recent, previous image was this one.</p>

<h2>Vs. the Old Screen</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//postimages/20141109_iPhone.jpg"></p>

<p>Instapaper is out.  I still use it on the desktop sometime but, since
I switched to Safari (yep), it has reading mode which is easy and
basically does the same thing.</p>

<p>I really like Read Quick and I&rsquo;m a fan of Clayton and Natalie Morris,
at least when they&rsquo;re on Twit.tv podcasts.  It&rsquo;s a neat idea and it
actually works, but I just wasn&rsquo;t using it.  When I&rsquo;m commuting
(driving) and at other times I&rsquo;m more often listening than reading.  I
just stopped using it very much.</p>

<p>The dreaded Facebook has arrived.  Yeah.  I finally decided to bite
the bullet and try using Facebook for news as well as family goings on
so I listened to Robert Scoble explain to Leo Laporte how to tune
Facebook&rsquo;s news feed, groups, etc.  I&rsquo;ve been using it since February.</p>

<p>I just removed Evernote and put Byword there a few minutes ago.  I&rsquo;m a
fan of Evernote but they seem to be struggling (as the press puts it)
and I decided it was a good time to move another one of my data sinks
to the text-Markdown world.  So now I write notes using Drafts, save
them to Dropbox (where they are titled and formatted) and access them
using various Markdown formatters.  The formatter that allows both
previewing the Markdown but also editing the notes within Dropbox is
Byword.  On the Mac desktop I use Marked for previewing and, of
course, just Emacs in a terminal window to edit.  This has been
working surprisingly well.  The only thing missing right now is that
Byword doesn&rsquo;t render included images.  There are some competing
standards between apps on how that&rsquo;s done, i.e., how images are
included.  There is Multi-markdown and I think it has a standard way,
but Byword doesn&rsquo;t seem to use it.  I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve done all of the
required homework on that one, though.</p>

<p>I still have my Evernote account and it&rsquo;s still on my phone, but just
not on the home screen.  I also exported my notes and wrote an XML
parser (well, I used the Python pre-existing XML library) to un-XML
them.</p>

<p>Drafts is a wonderful app I&rsquo;ve been using for a while.  As everyone
that talks about it says, it&rsquo;s just for entering text.  It opens super
fast and it&rsquo;s ready for you just to type.  I have it set up to take
notes and save them to Dropbox with the formatting described above.
It&rsquo;s where my notes went, even when I was using Evernote.  From other
apps&#8217; Share sheets, I can send things to Drafts so it basically
connects all of my apps together.</p>

<p>Finally, Safari.  Chrome just keeps bloating in various ways and I
heard that Safari handled battery life on the iPhone in a much better
way.  That makes sense.  It seems secure enough (but note the most
recent &ldquo;pwn&rdquo; (however you spell it) conference where Chrome withstood
and Safari fell two or three times.  I tried switching to Safari quite
a few months ago, both on the phone and desktop, and I&rsquo;ve been using
it ever since.  There are some Google apps that Chrome handles better,
mainly their finance stock charts, but usually Safari is fine.  Chrome
is still on my phone and I still use it at work.  I wouldn&rsquo;t argue
that Safari is better (except for the memory footprint, maybe faster
and with better battery management where I <em>would</em> argue it&rsquo;s better),
but it&rsquo;s seemed good enough so far.</p>

    <updated>2016-09-23T23:02:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2016/09/23/no-microservices</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An article titled &ldquo;Microservices – Please, don’t&rdquo; caught my eye, but I
think the author has it wrong.  It&rsquo;s true we&rsquo;ve been using the micro
service approach at work, building REST/JSON servers to provice APIs,
and I have been questioning whether this is the best approach.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>This author says that these are &ldquo;truths&rdquo; &ldquo;that people believe about
this approach&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<ol>
<li>It keeps the code cleaner</li>
<li>It’s easy to write things that only have one purpose</li>
<li>They’re faster than monoliths</li>
<li>It’s easy for engineers to not all work in the same codebase</li>
<li>It’s the simplest way to handle autoscaling, plus Docker is in here somewhere</li>
</ol>


<p>None of these have ever been my motivation for micro services.   I
never thought 1. was the case.  Clean code is the result of good style
and discipline, and readability in writing code.</p>

<p>Similarly, I&rsquo;m not sure what 2. has to do with micro services.  I can
write modules, objects, or functions that have only one purpose.</p>

<p>I never thought 3. was true but actually the opposite.  We&rsquo;re
replacing a local function call with a network transaction.</p>

<p>Similarly, 4. is also just not true.  Whether micro services are in
the picture or not, I take it as a given that code is properly divided
into reasonable components with well-defined interfaces and that are
loosely coupled.</p>

<p>I doubt that 5. is true, but it might be.  Scale has never been a
consideration in my thinking about micro services.</p>

<p>Here are some reasons that have been part of my thought process.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The API is language independent.  A program written in Java can
send an HTTP request as easily as a Python program, or a program in
any other language can.</p></li>
<li><p>The API is easy to test with something as simple as curl.</p></li>
<li><p>The API and HTTP request can cross network boundaries and into
different security domains, if permission is set up.</p></li>
<li><p>If a component needs to be recompiled, the micro services don&rsquo;t
need to be recompiled.</p></li>
<li><p>The micro service can be updated independently of the using code and
the clients all get the update immediately and with no changes.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>There are downsides I have worried about, though.  They include
standing up and maintaining so many services along with a lot of extra
network traffic.  It&rsquo;s also true that a well written library module is
easier to use and test in many ways.  The recompiling is not
necessarily a large cost.</p>

<p>On a very recent project at work, we went back to using libraries for
all of the application layers and components.  It&rsquo;s nice not to have
to stand up those services, but I&rsquo;ll find out if I miss some of those
advantages of the micro services.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In watching Pycon 2016 vidoes and other reading, I&rsquo;ve been struck with
the notion that it&rsquo;s actually time to move to Python 3.  More than
once in the sessions I&rsquo;ve heard a comment like &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be using Python
3.  If you haven&rsquo;t moved to Python 3 yet, what&rsquo;s stopping you?&rdquo;</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Good question.  There&rsquo;s the issue of some libraries not supporting
Python 3 but, in my humble beginnings, I haven&rsquo;t run into any yet.</p>

<p>Strings and UTF-8 are by far the stickiest set of issues I&rsquo;ve
encountered, but it&rsquo;s usually just a case of fixing them.  And really
I&rsquo;ve only tried converting one old program.  For new programs I&rsquo;m more
and more starting them right off in Python 3.</p>

<p>However, it&rsquo;s really recommended that you write code that runs in
both.  That takes a bit more effort and is a little more tricky.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.  I&rsquo;ll maybe update on that part next.</p>
