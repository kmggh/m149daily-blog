<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s apparently once again time to take the leap.  I&rsquo;m moving
Monolith149 Daily from Blogger, where it&rsquo;s lived since May of 2006.
The new home is a combination of writing posts in Markdown, created by
John Gruber at Daring Fireball, on a local
machine, generating a static blog using Octopress, and publishing the
blog on Github Pages.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the convenience of editing in Blogger and posting on
Blogspot.  However, increasing concerns over never knowing what Google
might do without warning, along with Google&rsquo;s new goal to &ldquo;organize
the world&rsquo;s information and make it exclusively available to logged-in
users on Google Plus,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve felt a growing urge to move my data back
home.</p>

<p>In spite of that, I&rsquo;m still an avid and nearly hourly user of Google&rsquo;s
vast supply of services and apps. I&rsquo;ve used Gmail from the beginning,
and I still enjoy Google documents and app engine.</p>

<h2>So Far</h2>

<p>Before the last move to Blogger in 2006, I was using Blosxom which was
also a text-file-based source system.  Blosxom was a Perl program (as
I recall) that generated the web pages on the fly, dynamically, from
the text sources.  It ran on Monolith, which was my desktop computer
for along time, and was also my web server.  That&rsquo;s because this was
in the &ldquo;old days&rdquo; when the university didn&rsquo;t have a firewall and <em>all</em>
of the desktop computers were on the Internet.  (Along with all you&rsquo;d
expect to follow).</p>

<p>Blosxom began to bog down as the number of posts and years grew.  In
addition, it seemed wise then to move my personal blog to a more
personal place that was &ldquo;my own,&rdquo; if you could define a blog on
Blogspot that way.</p>

<p>When I began blogging (I recently wrote about the <a href="http://monolith149daily.blogspot.com/2011/09/nine-years-ago.html">ninth</a> and <a href="http://monolith149daily.blogspot.com/2012/12/ten-years-of-blogging.html">tenth</a>
anniversaries) back in 2002, I was writing the blogs on Blogger and keeping the
source there.  But I ftp-published them back to my desktop, Monolith,
where they were served from.</p>

<p>Lately there&rsquo;s been a lot of buzz from bloggers, and people who look
like bloggers, about Markdown.  I finally dipped into Markdown a bit
when I began experimenting with using Github.  From my point of view,
it&rsquo;s nearly the same as many wiki markup schemes that have been around
for a long time, so it&rsquo;s very easy.</p>

<p>I miss some of the ability to do things like adjust text size, change
fonts, etc.  But, the trade off is that the original content is in a
source language that should be, in theory, easy to move over to other
systems and homes in the future.  And in the worst case, it&rsquo;s pretty
simple, readable text anyway.  You can just preserve the source files
and have a useful record of what I write and post.</p>

<h2>Octopress</h2>

<p>Then I somehow heard about Octopress.  At first I was a little put off
by some work required to install and set up yet another software
package with dependencies and such.  I did have to fiddle around with
Ruby versions on an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS system, and deal with something
called Gems and bundles.  I&rsquo;ve been happy enough with Perl and Python
over the years to not feel the need to dive into Ruby.</p>

<p>I got it all set up and working.  It took some more reading and
experimenting to get various customizations working.  I wasn&rsquo;t happy with
the default fonts for article titles&mdash;they were way too big and heavy.</p>

<h2>Publishing</h2>

<p>Finally, there was the question of where to publish.  I looked at
Amazon S3 which is excellent for putting up a static site.  However,
there wasn&rsquo;t a tool provided by AWS itself to upload or update a
hierarchy of files.  There were external tools and I could write my
own code, but I was a little hesitant to have to keep up with some of
those smaller open source projects.</p>

<p>I briefly looked at Dropbox.  There are some reasonably
well-established services that will serve out a Dropbox folder as a web
site, so it&rsquo;s not an unreasonable choice.</p>

<p>However, in the end, I landed on an unexpected delight, Github Pages.
Octopress highly recommends Github Pages for publishing.  I&rsquo;m
comfortable enough with Git, now that I use it at work every day, and
with Github itself.  Github Pages is a wonderful service that allows
publishing a static web site for free.  Actually, they have support for
layout and content generation that I didn&rsquo;t really look into.</p>

<p>It was quite easy and straightforward to set up the repo and publish
the Octopress-generated pages to it.</p>

<h2>Concerns</h2>

<p>The one thing that has worried me the most about this new arrangement
is the heavier lifting required to actually get posts up.  Would that
be enough extra friction to impede posting? Writing the text is easy,
but there are a few steps required to publish.  Granted, Octopress
actually has some built-in automation for one-command deployment of
new content.  I haven&rsquo;t ensured that it&rsquo;s all set up and working, and
made sure I&rsquo;ve dealt with any assumptions it makes. Maybe I&rsquo;ll get to
that at some point.</p>

<h2>Finally</h2>

<p>One thing I&rsquo;ll continue, which I began in recent years, is not
hesitating to use the blog for tweet-length posts and link sharing.
When it became clear that Twitter severely limited users&#8217; ability to
retrieve an archive of their tweets, I moved away from putting any
important content on Twitter to posting it on the blog and letting
Feedburner echo it to my Twitter account.  Earlier this year, Twitter
finally added the ability to retrieve your complete archive.</p>

<p>So, here I am, starting Chapter Four of my blogging endeavor.  There
will probably continue to be some style adjustments and changes as I
go along and who knows, there is likely to be another move sometime in
the future.  It will be interesting to see how long the investment in
Markdown source holds up.</p>
