<p>I can now summarize my previous post up in one sentence:  Android had
become tiring and I find the iPhone delightful.</p>

<p>The new iPhone 5C arrived on Wed 2013-10-02 and I found the transition
from the almost-two-year-old Android Galaxy Nexus 4.2.2 easy and
painless.  So far I&rsquo;m happy using a new device with a fresh new
interface and all that I consider essential.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>I ordered the iPhone 5C on-line at the Apple Store.  The process was
simple and integration with my Verizon account and changes were
straightforward.  There was no charge for shipping and the device
shipped by UPS and arrived in two days, i.e., I ordered it on Monday
and it arrived on Wednesday.  Somehow, Apple got the idea it should
have arrived on Tuesday and sent an apologetic email alert about a
shipping delay.</p>

<p>Transitioning the phone over to my Verizon account after turning it on
was equally simple and only involved entering my phone number and the
other typical identifying information Verizon wants.</p>

<p>Syncing my Gmail/Google contact list to the phone was a quick web
search and simply adding that account to the Settings for the phone.
I enabled contact syncing (but not email!) and much later, this
morning in fact, I turned on calendar syncing.  I didn&rsquo;t sync email
because I&rsquo;m using the Gmail app and not the iPhone email app.</p>

<h2>Apps</h2>

<p>For installing apps I logged into my existing Apple account with no
problem.  In the first evening I was able to easily install nearly
every app I consider essential, including all of the Google apps like
Gmail, Maps, Chrome and more.</p>

<p>I continued to pull down apps over the next few days as I thought of
them, needed them, or just had time to&mdash;the demand paging
approach.</p>

<p>Amazon Cloud player was also an easy install and works just as it does
on the Android.  It will stream from the cloud or download songs,
albums, or playlists to the phone to play them locally.</p>

<p>With a quick search of some on-line recommendations I settled on the
excellent program, Downcast, for downloading and playing podcasts.
Though I liked Doggcatcher on Android, I think Downcast is actually
much better.</p>

<p>I figured out how to rearrange the apps on the screens so that the
important apps were on the bottom bar (Amazon Cloud Player, Phone,
Messages, Chrome), how to put apps into folders, etc.  As expected,
there&rsquo;s still fiddling around left to do to get the arrangement of
apps and organization of the screens balanced so they work best for
me, but it&rsquo;s very workable right now.</p>

<h2>Anticipated Problems</h2>

<p>For the most part, things I worried about the most haven&rsquo;t been any
trouble at all.</p>

<p>Having no back button doesn&rsquo;t really cause a problem.  Apps usually
provide their own back button, or some equivalent, when you&rsquo;d need
one.  It&rsquo;s usually in the upper left corner.  And there&rsquo;s bailing out
with the home button but I rarely find myself using that as an
alternative to a back button.</p>

<p>Other changes in using a different interface just haven&rsquo;t been a
problem.  The new UI has been easy and fast to learn.  I like it a lot
and, since I didn&rsquo;t have IOS 6 as a reference, I don&rsquo;t have anything
to complain about regarding differences.</p>

<p>Surprisingly I don&rsquo;t miss the widgets at all.  There&rsquo;s a nice economy
of focus to only seeing information when you want to see it.  There&rsquo;s
not the distraction of some random Facebook update and, well, I guess
I just didn&rsquo;t really depend that much on the other widgets.  So, I
thought widgets were really neat, I still do, but I&rsquo;ve found they
aren&rsquo;t essential.  Perhaps that means they&rsquo;re really clutter, but I
like them enough I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest they be removed from Android.</p>

<p>One of the advantages of Android is the ability to customize almost
anything and everything.  It&rsquo;s probably my personal stage of phone
usage, but I don&rsquo;t want to do that kind of hacking, I just want
something that works.</p>

<h2>No perfect box</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the worst thing about the iPhone 5C: the box.  Most Apple
products come in packaging that&rsquo;s so nice you hate to throw it away.
The 5C came in a somewhat annoying, oversized, retro-like plastic
case.  And the worst sin of all, it was sealed with tape that left
behind a pet-roller-like sticky band which makes you want to throw
whole thing away as quickly as possible.  The opposite effect of the
typical packaging.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s not that important, really.  Just bothersome.</p>

<h2>Missing out on the Nexus 5</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mind.  If the leaked LG information is accurate, the Nexus 5
isn&rsquo;t attention-grabbing to me.  I have more to say in another post
about why that may be.  If I&rsquo;d waited and then sprung for the Moto X
or Nexus 5, I&rsquo;d have a phone nearly the same as what I had.  It might
perform better from some ratchet clicks of CPU specs, but I don&rsquo;t know
if I&rsquo;d notice.  Maybe.</p>

<h2>Reality check</h2>

<p>I know I&rsquo;m still grazing on the greener grass at the start of a
new-phone honeymoon.  The real test will be how its working after one,
six and 12 months.  But I have to say, being able to fall right in
with all that I consider essential right there and a nice solid
interface and hardware, I can&rsquo;t see the complaints yet.</p>
