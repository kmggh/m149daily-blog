<div class="entry-content"><p><em>While looking for earlier posts about kids and programming, I came
across this from a 2005-02-08 post.  Someone sent this to me and I
don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s real or not.  In any event, I enjoyed these.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>These came from the annual &ldquo;Dark and Stormy Night&rdquo; competition. Actual
analogies and metaphors found in high school essays:</p>

<ol>
<li>Her face was a perfect oval, like a circle that had its two sides
gently compressed by a Thigh Master.</li>
</ol>


<!-- More -->


<ol>
<li><p>His thoughts tumbled in his head, making and breaking alliances
like underpants in a dryer without Cling Free.</p></li>
<li><p>He spoke with the wisdom that can only come from experience, like a
guy who went blind because he looked at a solar eclipse without one of
those boxes with a pinhole in it and now goes around the country
speaking at high schools about the dangers of looking at a solar
eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it.</p></li>
<li><p>She grew on him like she was a colony of E. coli and he was
room-temperature Canadian beef.</p></li>
<li><p>She had a deep, throaty, genuine laugh, like that sound a dog makes
just before it throws up.</p></li>
<li><p>Her vocabulary was as bad as, like, whatever.</p></li>
<li><p>He was as tall as a six-foot-three-inch tree.</p></li>
<li><p>The revelation that his marriage of 30 years had disintegrated
because of his wife&rsquo;s infidelity came as a rude shock, like a
surcharge at a formerly surcharge-free ATM.</p></li>
<li><p>The little boat gently drifted across the pond exactly the way a
bowling
ball wouldn&rsquo;t.</p></li>
<li><p>McBride fell 12 stories, hitting the pavement like a Hefty bag
filled with vegetable soup.</p></li>
<li><p>From the attic came an unearthly howl. The whole scene had an
eerie, surreal quality, like when you&rsquo;re on vacation in another city
and Jeopardy comes on at 7:00 p.m. instead of 7:30.</p></li>
<li><p>Her hair glistened in the rain like a nose hair after a sneeze.</p></li>
<li><p>The hailstones leaped from the pavement, just like maggots when
you fry them in hot grease.</p></li>
<li><p>Long separated by cruel fate, the star-crossed lovers raced across
the grassy field toward each other like two freight trains, one having
left Cleveland at 6:36 p.m. traveling at 55 mph, the other from Topeka
at 4:19 p.m. at a speed of 35 mph.</p></li>
<li><p>They lived in a typical suburban neighborhood with picket fences
that resembled Nancy Kerrigan&rsquo;s teeth.</p></li>
<li><p>John and Mary had never met. They were like two hummingbirds who
had also never met.</p></li>
<li><p>He fell for her like his heart was a mob informant and she was the
East River.</p></li>
<li><p>Even in his last years, Grandpappy had a mind like a steel trap,
only one that had been left out so long, it had rusted shut.</p></li>
<li><p>Shots rang out, as shots are wont to do.</p></li>
<li><p>The plan was simple, like my brother-in-law Phil. But unlike Phil,
this plan just might work.</p></li>
<li><p>The young fighter had a hungry look, the kind you get from not
eating for a while.</p></li>
<li><p>He was as lame as a duck. Not the metaphorical lame duck, either,
but a real duck that was actually lame, maybe from stepping on a land
mine or something.</p></li>
<li><p>The ballerina rose gracefully en pointe and extended one slender
leg behind her, like a dog at a fire hydrant.</p></li>
<li><p>It was an American tradition, like fathers chasing kids around
with power tools.</p></li>
<li><p>He was deeply in love. When she spoke, he thought he heard bells,
as if she were a garbage truck backing up.</p></li>
<li><p>Her eyes were like limpid pools, only they had forgotten to put in
any pH cleanser.</p></li>
<li><p>She walked into my office like a centipede with 98 missing legs.</p></li>
</ol>
