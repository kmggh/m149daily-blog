<div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve used email since the beginning of the early days of the
Internet&rsquo;s explosion in the mid-80s.  It&rsquo;s gone through quite an
evolution as have my methods of managing what is probably a massive
flood of incoming information.  Since my methods work pretty well for
me, I really wouldn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Lately I hear people either discussing how they fight their huge
battle with email, sometimes winning and sometimes losing, and I&rsquo;m
struck by how often they seem to miss some techniques I&rsquo;ve taken for granted
for years now.</p>

<p>In my current job I spend about 20 minutes reading email in the
morning.  After that, all of the email labels (basically folders if
that&rsquo;s the paradigm you use) are read, I&rsquo;m at what is sometimes called
&ldquo;inbox zero.&rdquo;  Throughout the rest of the day, I watch for occasional
emails from my team and the chain of people I report to.  That&rsquo;s
basically it.  I never see an email message that I wouldn&rsquo;t want to.</p>

<p>Here are the main techniques that I&rsquo;ve found success in using.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Use Gmail</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used Gmail since it came out in 2004, both for personal and work
email.  In all that time, I&rsquo;ve never deleted an email message.  That
was an original idea of Gmail, you were never expected to.  Google&rsquo;s
email service effectively deals with spam so that&rsquo;s immediately out of
the equation.  I&rsquo;ve barely given a thought to spam in that many
years. I don&rsquo;t check my spam folder.  There were maybe two times when
I seemed to be missing a message and I found a false positive in
there, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>Some people seem to be mystified by or simply don&rsquo;t like the
conversation view.  I can&rsquo;t imagine why this is.  It&rsquo;s the most
effective and logical to view an exchange of messages.  The list of
&ldquo;messages&rdquo; (actually conversations) in a mailbox is immediately
shorter, you can see how many are unread by conversation, and the
snippets show you a bit of context.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used or taken a careful look at most of the email programs,
interfaces and services over it&rsquo;s history, particularly in roles of
providing user support and also being a system administrator of email
servers.  Please take my word for this, conversations in Gmail is the
best way to read email.</p>

<h2>Use Filters and Labels</h2>

<p>I use lots of filters.  The filters themselves aren&rsquo;t terribly
complicated.  Usually they either filter by who the email is from (one
of my bosses), who it&rsquo;s to, typically an email list, e.g., my team,
and sometimes the subject line.</p>

<p>The filter usually skips the inbox which means the message won&rsquo;t
appear there.  (Gmail tip:  There is no inbox.  There&rsquo;s nothing but a
gigantic barrel of all of your email, but you typically view it by
labels on the email. &ldquo;Inbox&rdquo; is just another label.  So is
&ldquo;Spam&rdquo;. Etc.)  They usually go into a custom label and may be marked
as read or not.</p>

<p>When naming labels, I give them names so they are properly sorted in
the left hand column.  Important filters start with the letter A,
e.g., &ldquo;A Bosses&rdquo;, &ldquo;A Team&rdquo;, &ldquo;A Project XYZ.&rdquo;  The filters for those
labels won&rsquo;t be marked as read so I can see how many unread messages
there are from a boss, my team, on the project.</p>

<p>After that come some less important labels like &ldquo;B Some Other
Project&rdquo;, &ldquo;B Meeting X&rdquo;, etc.  Those might be unread or they might
actually be marked as read.  They don&rsquo;t show up as bold with an
unread count, but I can go look at that &ldquo;pile&rdquo; if I ever need to see
what&rsquo;s been going on there.  Similarly, there are a few labels
starting with &ldquo;C&rdquo; that are even farther down on the list.</p>

<p>Below those, and probably off the screen, are labels without a special
sorting letter in their name.  Usually all of those are marked as read
(by the filter when the email arrives) and chances are I&rsquo;ll never look
at them.  This is where things go like chatty notification services
which is effectively noise.  There maybe tens of thousands of messages
in these.  If there were some particular kinds of messages in there I
needed so see, lost in that noise, then that means writing a more
specific filter to put those messages in a more important label and
leaving them unread.</p>

<p>Finally, you can set each label to be shown or not.   If you mark it
as not shown, then it won&rsquo;t even be in the left-hand list  when you
scroll down.  At the end of the list it says &ldquo;More&rdquo; with a little
arrow.  You click that to extend the list with the rest of the
not-shown labels.  If there are labels of mail I don&rsquo;t even care to
remember the existence of, I don&rsquo;t need to be reminded they are there,
I put them in that list.  It&rsquo;s like the closet, or maybe even the
trash heap.</p>

<p>After all of the filtering is done, all that remains in my inbox is
the general, uncategorized email, that I need to ready on a daily
basis.  That&rsquo;s reduced down to the 20 or so messages I read each day.</p>

<h2>Read Selectively</h2>

<p>Now I can look at my labels in the morning and see what messages
are there.  There are maybe 10 labels I read each morning but I don&rsquo;t
go through each label reading messages one by one.</p>

<p>I read the reporting chain label, team mail, and then typically the
inbox next.  Note that I&rsquo;ve been a GTD advocate and user for some six
years, so, of course, I don&rsquo;t spend more than a couple of minutes on a
message.  If a message is a long read, or requires something to be
done, I add an item to my Next Actions list, or some appropriate
list.  I usually put a link back to the message in the action.</p>

<p>(Gmail tip:  You can refer back to any particular conversation/message
by copying the link from the browser.  That link will always work for
that message.  I typically just add a word &ldquo;[Email]&rdquo; and link the
&ldquo;Email&rdquo; part to the message so I can just click on it.)</p>

<p>So I might have one or two new actions.</p>

<p>(Gmail tip:  You can search using the search term &ldquo;label:<label name>
is:unread&rdquo; to see all of the unread messages in a label.   This also
works for seeing just the unread messages in your inbox, e.g.,
&ldquo;label:inbox is:unread&rdquo;.  If I click on a label, the &ldquo;label:<label
name>&rdquo; is already in the search box (because that&rsquo;s all clicking on a
label does, it does that search).  Then, clicking in the search box
drops down the &ldquo;is:unread&rdquo; added to it because it&rsquo;s been used before,
so no typing is needed.</p>

<p>For some chains, I just flip through the messages quickly to see what
their content is.  If there&rsquo;s not a need to read it then or maybe
ever, I don&rsquo;t.  This is different from just marking it as read.  I
still open and look at each message to be sure I know what it&rsquo;s about.</p>

<p>For some labels, I don&rsquo;t even do that.  I just open the label and look
at the conversation subjects and snippets.  Often that&rsquo;s enough,
because this label already represents reduced importance.  Then I just
check all of the boxes by checking the one box up at the top of the
list, go to the &ldquo;More&rdquo; menu button and select &ldquo;Mark all as read.&rdquo;
Done for that label.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day I keep my team&rsquo;s label selected and ignore
most of the other labels, and the inbox, even though they accumulate
new, unread messages through the day.  They&rsquo;ll be dealt with next
morning.</p>

<h2>Concluding</h2>

<p>So, the basic idea is to tune the incoming email so I only see what I
need to see, and only read what&rsquo;s important.  I&rsquo;ve found that most of
this tuning can be done in four to six weeks of a new job, then there
is a decreasing number of tweaks through out six months to a year.
Beyond that, I only tweak a filter or add a label every three to six
months probably.</p>

<p>Some readers here may note that Gmail will automatically prioritize
your messages and even sort it into major categories to help you read
it.  I&rsquo;ve heard that these seem to work quite well.  I actually turn
all of those features off since my email handling is already finely
tuned.</p>

<p>Note what I don&rsquo;t worry about:  mail quotas, deciding what messages to
delete, organizing folders, spam.  Those are problems more than 10
years in my past.  I&rsquo;m amazed people still have to battle them on a
daily basis.</p>
