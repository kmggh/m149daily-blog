    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do worm holes even exist?  At Smithsonian.com, Victoria Jaggard
writes the article &ldquo;Would Astronauts Survive an Interstellar Trip Through a
Wormhole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Given the state of current physics the answer is, No.  The idea of
worm holes has come and gone in the science world, though it never
quite leaves.  The Kerr metric solution to Einstein&rsquo;s general
relativity equations applies to &ldquo;rotating&rdquo; black holes and adds new
twists, however there&rsquo;s still not really a way for humans to get
through.</p>

<p>Just like crossing an event horizon is beyond the edge of our
universe, these ideas are beyond the edge of our science.  Of course
we don&rsquo;t know everything and I have no doubt there are amazing things
still to be discovered.  I&rsquo;d never say it can&rsquo;t happen, just that we
don&rsquo;t have a good mechanism in our current astrophysics toolbox unless
we toss in a little magic.  Just like it is with faster-than-light
travel.</p>

<blockquote><p>Despite his ties to the film, [cosmologist Kip] Thorne is also
pessimistic that a traversable wormhole is even possible, much less
survivable. &ldquo;If they can exist, I doubt very much that they can form
naturally in the astrophysical universe,&rdquo; he writes in the book. But
Thorne appreciates that Christopher and Jonah Nolan, who wrote
Interstellar, were so keen to tell a story that is grounded in
science.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s more to come on this topic and other folks have weighed in.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>A team of astronomers using the Subaru Telescope&rsquo;s Suprime-Cam to
perform the Subaru Ultra-Deep Survey for Lyman-alpha Emitters have
looked back more than [<em>z=7</em>] to find 7 early galaxies that
appeared quite suddenly within 700 million years of the Big Bang. The
team, led by graduate student Akira Konno and Dr. Masami Ouchi
(Associate Professor at the University of Tokyo&rsquo;s ICRR) was looking
for a specific kind of galaxy called a Lyman-alpha emitter (LAE), to
understand the role such galaxies may have played in an event called
&ldquo;cosmic reionization&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<p>The team looked at distant galaxies that primarily emit Lyman-alpha
radiation, &ldquo;Lyman-alpha emitters&rdquo; or LAE, and saw fewer than expected,
further back in time.  There&rsquo;s an apparent sudden cutoff at that
redshift.  The redshift corresponds to a distance and time in history
that&rsquo;s model dependent.  The standard big bang model would put this at
about 13.1 billion years and only 700 million years after the big bang
itself.  The cosmological-history implication is that these galaxies
&ldquo;suddenly&rdquo; appear.</p>

<p>One thing is pretty certain.  A cosmological redshift of seven
indicates the universe was about 1/8 it&rsquo;s current size at the time the
light they observed was emitted.  That&rsquo;s 1 / (<em>z</em> + 1).</p>

<blockquote><p>According to the team&rsquo;s analysis, one reason that LAEs appeared very
quickly is cosmic reionization. LAEs in the epoch of cosmic
reionization became darker than the actual luminosity due to the
presence of the neutral hydrogen fog. In the team&rsquo;s analysis of their
observations, they suggest the possibility that the neutral fog
filling the universe was cleared about 13.0 billion years ago and LAEs
suddenly appeared in sight for the first time."</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, there are other possibilities to explain why LAEs appeared
suddenly,&rdquo; said Dr. Ouchi, who is the principal investigator of this
program. &ldquo;One is that clumps of neutral hydrogen around LAEs
disappeared. Another is that LAEs became intrinsically bright. The
reason of the intrinsic brightening is that the Lyman-alpha emission
is not efficiently produced by the ionized clouds in a LAE due to the
significant escape of ionizing photons from the galaxy. In either
case, our discovery is an important key to understanding cosmic
reionization and the properties of the LAEs in early universe.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>On 12 November 1971, exactly 43 years ago, Ray Bradbury spoke to an
audience at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the eve of Mariner 9
arriving at Mars.  On stage with him were Arthur C. Clarke, Carl
Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Walter Sullivan.  Bradbury read his poem, &ldquo;If
Only We Had Taller Been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today, on 12 November 2014, the Philae spacecraft &ldquo;docked&rdquo; with the
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.</p>

<p>From the ESA web site.</p>

<blockquote><p>Rosetta is a cornerstone mission to chase, go into orbit around, and
land on a comet. It is studying the Jupiter-family comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with a combination of remote sensing and in
situ measurements. The spacecraft arrived at the comet on 6 August
2014 following a 10-year journey through the Solar System. Between
August and November, the spacecraft has been orbiting the comet and
gathering data to characterise the environment and the comet
nucleus. On 12 November 2014, Rosetta&rsquo;s lander Philae will be deployed
to the surface. Philae carries a suite of instruments for imaging and
sampling the comet nucleus. The Rosetta orbiter will track the comet
through perihelion (August 2015), examining its behaviour before,
during and after.</p></blockquote>

<p>[SIC]:  I saw a pronunciation guide for Philae that said &ldquo;fee-lay.&rdquo;
This is wrong.  The pronunciation rhymes with eye-lee, or &ldquo;highly.&rdquo;
Whenever you see ae, it rhymes with ee as in leek.  For example,
Caesar.  And yes, the UNIX-famous word &ldquo;daemon&rdquo; is pronounced
precisely and exactly like demon. Other pronunciations are wrong.

    <link href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/11/06/buying-a-telescope-part-3/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-06T04:58:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/11/06/buying-a-telescope-part-3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 27</a></p>

<p>Some parting thoughts.</p>

<h2>Magnification</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a common misconception that telescopes are all about
magnification.  One sure sign of a questionable telescope is one that
puts its magnification up front.  Worse is one that advertises 200x,
300x, and more.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>It works like this.  The main mirror or lens, called the &ldquo;objective,&rdquo;
collects light, information, and produces a real image somewhere in
the back of the telescope.  It&rsquo;s usually inside the eyepiece holder.
It&rsquo;s called a real image because it acts like a little picture
floating there in space.  If you point a telescope at something and
look at the back of it, with no eyepiece, you can see the real image.</p>

<p>The quality of the image, including it&rsquo;s resolution, depends on the
amount of information collected by the objective, generally the larger
the aperture, the more detail is in the image.  The eyepiece is a
little magnifying lens you use to look at the image, just like you use
a magnifier to look at a small object like jewelry or a photograph.</p>

<p>If you imagine taking something with a picture like a newspaper,
magazine or a book (if you can even find one of those), and look at it
with say a 10x or 20x magnifier, you can probably see more details in
the picture.  You might be able to make out something that you missed
without the magnifier.</p>

<p>However, if you then find a 100x or 200x magnifier and look at the
picture, what do you think you&rsquo;ll see?  You&rsquo;ll probably see the dots
the picture is made of, or just a fuzzy blur but you won&rsquo;t see any
more details in the original picture.  There&rsquo;s not enough detail,
resolution, information in the picture for 200x to work.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the way a telescope real image works.  Even if the manufacturer
includes an eyepiece that gives 200x magnification, you&rsquo;ll just see an
unimpressive blur, if you could ever find the object at that
magnification.</p>

<p>Worse, you&rsquo;re also magnifying the speed at which an object in the
telescope appears to move (as the earth turns).  At 30x to 50x this
isn&rsquo;t that much a problem.  At 100x it&rsquo;s moving but you can keep up.
At higher magnifications, unless you have a mounting with a clock
drive, the object goes screaming by.</p>

<p>The basic rule of thumb is 20x to 30x per inch of aperture for normal
observing, and you might double it to get a closer look.  For a
2.4-inch telescope that means 40x to 80x.  Note in the previous post
that the Orion 2.4-inch has eyepieces for 28x and 70x.  That&rsquo;s
perfect!  200x or 400x for a 2.4 is absurd.</p>

<p>For the 4.5-inch telescope, 90x to 180x in theory are good.  It&rsquo;s
eyepieces at 36x and 91x are okay, but you could add an accessory to
take the 91x up to 150x to 200x but I&rsquo;d expect you to use those
magnifications rarely.</p>

<p>Back in the old observatory where we had a 14-inch Celestron
Schmidt-Cassegrain on a permanent pier mounting.  It was an f/11
telescope meaning the focal length was 154-inches (14 x 11) which
equals 3912 mm.  Our typical eyepieces when public observing were a
32-mm and 10-mm.  The 32-mm gave 122x and 24-mm at 162x.
(Magnification is just the telescope focal length divided by the
eyepiece focal length). We might use
a 10-mm or so for 391x, but usually not for the general public.  At
some point, the atmosphere itself limits the detail in the image,
regardless of how large the telescope is.  Astronomers call that
effect the &ldquo;seeing.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Clock Drives and Tracking</h2>

<p>As discussed above, we&rsquo;re standing on a moving platform, the earth.
For that reason, the whole sky is constantly turning as if we&rsquo;re on a
merry-go-round.  The sun, moon, stars, everything in the sky rises in
the east and sets in the west for this reason. Some telescopes have an
equatorial mounting and a clock drive or computer driven tracking
system to follow the stars across the sky.  If you&rsquo;re just doing
visual observing, and you have a good mounting, you can easily keep
the object you&rsquo;re observing in the field of view.  There&rsquo;s great joy
in visual observing this way.</p>

<p>If you do become interested in some types of visual imaging or more
serious observing of certain types, then you may want to look at a
telescope with a tracking system like this, but I wouldn&rsquo;t start with
one.</p>

<h2>Try Before You Buy</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great idea to see what it&rsquo;s like to use a telescope.  Visit
your local planetarium or observatory on an observing night or find a
local astronomy club.  Maybe go to a meeting or two, one where they
offer some presentation or have a speaker on some topic and then,
either at the same meeting or a separate one, where members bring
their telescopes which they&rsquo;ll happily show you along with views of a
variety of objects through them.</p>

<h2>Use the Internet</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve skipped explaining a lot of terms and concepts that surround
amateur astronomy and telescopes.  Excellent explanations are readily
available on the Internet.  Orion has nice tutorials and beginner
guides on their site.  Of course Wikipedia has articles on many topics
surrounding amateur telescopes.  And you&rsquo;ll find other sources.</p>

<p>You should also download the free software for your computer,
<em>Stellarium</em>.  This is a beautiful &ldquo;planetarium program&rdquo; that shows
you the current night sky or the sky from any location, time and date
on earth.  You can use it to learn constellations, what planets are
visible, and every other object in the sky an amateur would be
interested in.  You can also print star maps to take outside.</p>
