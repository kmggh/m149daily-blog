    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/postimages/Moon-Earth_distance,_Moon_phases.gif"></p>

<p>The hyped story about the &ldquo;Super Moon&rdquo; is near the top of our on-line
news feeds.  I&rsquo;ll try to untangle the hype from some facts.  It&rsquo;s true
that this <em>full Moon</em> will be the closest since 1948-01-26.</p>

<p>The next closest super Moon will be in 2034, only four years before
our UNIX calendars run out of steam.</p>

<p>But how big a deal is this?  And what&rsquo;s really going on?</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Short version</h2>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to dive into the details below, here&rsquo;s the long
story short.  Every month the Moon is closer and farther from the
Earth as it follows its elliptical orbit.  Due to the tidal force from
the Sun, sometimes those distances are a little more extreme than
others.</p>

<p>The so-called  &ldquo;Super Moon&rdquo; occurs when the full Moon coincides very
closely with the Moon&rsquo;s closest approach, apogee, to the Earth for the
year.  But it&rsquo;s really only around 3% larger than any other close
approach during the year, and these happen every year.  They just
don&rsquo;t always occur when the Moon is almost exactly full.</p>

<h2>Kepler&rsquo;s first law</h2>

<p>Kepler&rsquo;s first law is that orbits have the shape of an ellipse with
the primary body at one of the two foci.  In this case the Earth is at
the focus.  The ellipse means the Moon moves closer to and farther
away from the Earth as it goes around.  It&rsquo;s closest point is called
the perigee, and the farthest point is the apogee.</p>

<h2>Sun&rsquo;s tidal forces</h2>

<p>Tidal forces stretch things.  The tidal force due to the Sun&rsquo;s and
Moon&rsquo;s gravity stretch the Earth&rsquo;s oceans so they have high points and
low points.  The tidal force of the Sun also stretches the Moon&rsquo;s
orbit.  When the Sun is in the direction of the long ellipse, the Sun
stretches it in a longer ellipse.  The extreme distances are even more
extreme:</p>

<p>apogee = 406,700 km, perigee = 356,400 km.</p>

<p>When the Sun is at right angles to the major axis, the orbit is pulled
into a less eccentric ellipse and the extremes are reduced.</p>

<p>apogee = 404,000 km, perigee = 370,400 km.</p>

<h2>Monthly motions</h2>

<p>Every month the Moon passes apogee and perigee as it orbits the
Earth.  In the excellent diagram above from the Wikipedia article on
the &ldquo;Orbit of the Moon,&rdquo; you can see the varying distance of the
Moon from the Earth plotted.  The minimum points are the perigee,
closest, distance.  Each month, when the Moon is at perigee, it will appear
a bit larger, than when it&rsquo;s farther away.</p>

<p>Notice how the minimum and maximum distances are not as extreme in
April as they are in August.  That&rsquo;s the Sun&rsquo;s tidal effect.</p>

<p>In this diagram, which was for 2014, it looks like the Moon was closest
to the Earth in about the second week of August at perigee.</p>

<h2>Moon phases</h2>

<p>The other thing in this diagram is the phase of the Moon.  The
diagonal lines show the Moon going from new (phase = 0) to full (phase
= 0.5) and back to new each month.  The vertical lines show when the
new Moons occur.</p>

<p>What we&rsquo;re really interested in here is the <em>full Moon</em> so it would
have been nice if there were vertical lines halfway in between the new
Moons to mark the phase = 0.5 full Moons.</p>

<h2>The big deal</h2>

<p>So now we have all the pieces to understand what the big deal is.
It&rsquo;s this.  How close does the full Moon come to the closest perigee
of the year?  Well, it almost never hits it perfectly, but it varies
from year to year.  In the year in the diagram, it looks like the
halfway full-Moon point would fall nearly on the mid-August closest
perigee.</p>

<p>Using the perigee-apogee calculator from below for 2014 we find the
full Moon hit the closest perigee on 2014-08-10 almost exactly, zero
hours difference!  The perigee distance was 356,896 km.</p>

<p>In contrast, this year they missed by about 2 hours on 2016-11-14 at a
distance of 356,511 km.  So the full Moon was off a bit, but the
closest perigee this year was a bit closer.  Why a bit closer?  It has
to do with the angle of the Sun to the ellipse of the Moon&rsquo;s orbit.</p>

<h2>But it isn&rsquo;t really</h2>

<p>So that timing of full Moon and closest perigee of the year is what
it&rsquo;s all about.  But notice that the Moon gets this close every year!
It&rsquo;s just not necessarily at, or exactly at, the time of the full
Moon.  Further, the Moon gets almost that close every month!</p>

<p>As we said above, the closet perigee distance is 356,400 km while the
farthest perigee is 370,400.  That&rsquo;s 3.93% larger from the farthest
perigee to closest.  That&rsquo;s how much the &ldquo;close&rdquo; Moon varies through
the year.</p>

<p>So where did the big 14% come from that I kept seeing in all of these
articles.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the difference in size between when the Moon is at apogee vs
perigee, and that happens every month, two weeks apart.  Actually it&rsquo;s
about 13.36% when the ellipse is stretched, and about 9.8% when it&rsquo;s
not.</p>

<p>So again, this happens <em>every</em> month, but just not when the Moon is
full.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brian Ventrudo writes about five classic telescopes in this article on
the <em>One-Minute Astronomer</em> blog.  Here&rsquo;s my own experience with these
instruments.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Unitron</h2>

<p>We had a 2.4 at the museum observatory and it was a
beautiful and delightful telescope.  I used it to observe, visually
via projection, the 1984 annular solar eclipse when I saw the Sun&rsquo;s
corona.</p>

<h2>Questar</h2>

<p>These portable little 3.5-inch Maksutovs were the beautiful jewels of
astronomy.  My planetarium and astronomical mentor, Mike Hood, has
collected Questars over the years.</p>

<h2>Celestron</h2>

<p>The leading Schmidt-Cassegrain brand ruled over our observatory.  We
had a 10-inch model identical to the one in Ventrudo&rsquo;s article.  It
was mounted on a permanent pier on the observatory floor.  There was
also the 14-in Celestron and two 8-inch models which I hauled around
to do observing programs.  I observed a large portion of the Messier
catalog on those 8-inches.</p>

<h2>RV-6 Dynascope</h2>

<p>The classic Criterion 6-in f/8 is a telescope I never owned or used
but I&rsquo;ve seen and looked through the RV-6.  I think there might have
been one added to the observatory collection after my time.  This
telescope and the corresponding Edmund Scientific 6-in f/8 Newtonian,
were the telescopes I dreamed most about in my early, teen astronomer
years.</p>

<h2>Coulter Dobs</h2>

<p>Dobsonian telescopes, which came to light around the turn of the
decade to 1980, changed amateur astronomy.  Large apertures became
affordable and usable.  I built my own 10-inch f/4.5 but bought the
optics from Coulter.</p>

<p>From Victoria Jaggard, National Georgraphic.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Kaguya (Selene) lunar orbiter, a Japanese spacecraft nicknamed
after a legendary moon princess, launched in 2007 carrying two
high-definition TV cameras, which it used to capture stunning video
and pictures of the lunar surface.</p>

<p>Although the mission ended in 2009, this week the Japanese space
agency released the entire haul of digital images captured by Kaguya
during its lifetime. Some of the images have never been seen before by
the public.</p></blockquote>
