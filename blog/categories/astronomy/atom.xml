    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally found the paper for the recent LIGO discovery of gravity
waves from a black hole merger, event GW150914 at 2015-09-14 09:50:45
+0000 which data implies was the merging of two black holes, one with
mass 36 (+5, -4) solar masses and the other 29 (+4, -4) solar masses
into an object of 62 (+4, -4) solar masses with 3 (+0.5, -0.5) solar
masses radiated away (lost) as emitted gravitational waves.</p>

<p>B.P. Abbot and collaborators say,</p>

<blockquote><p>Over 0.2 s, the signal increases in frequency and amplitude in about 8
cycles from 35 to 150 Hz, where the amplitude reaches a maximum. The
most plausible explanation for this evolution is the inspiral of two
orbiting masses, m1 and m2, due to gravitational-wave emission.</p></blockquote>

<p>The source redshift was measured as <em>z</em>=0.09 (+0.03, -0.04).</p>

<p>One interesting outcome in the conclusions is support for massive
black holes.</p>

<blockquote><p>GW150914 demonstrates the existence of stellar-mass black holes more
massive than ≃ 25 solar masses, and establishes that binary black
holes can form in nature and merge within a Hubble time. Binary
black holes have been predicted to form both in isolated binaries
and in dense environments by dynamical interactions.  The
formation of such massive black holes from stellar evolution
requires weak massive-star winds, which are possible in stellar
environments with metallicity lower than ≃ &frac12; the solar value.</p></blockquote>

    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2015/08/02/blue-moon-definition-was-wrong</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a blog post I published in Mon 2010-11-22 on the previous
<a href="http://monolith149daily.blogspot.com/2010/11/blue-moon-definition-was-wrong.html">Monolith149 Daily
Site</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>What does this mean?  According to the &ldquo;new incorrect definition&rdquo; the
 blue moon was this past week 31 Jul (based on time zone actually) but
 the next &ldquo;old correct definition&rdquo; blue moon is not actually until 2016-05-21!</em></p>

<p>From a Space.com article by Joe Rao.</p>

<p>I was wrong.  My wife said last night that the moon was a blue moon.
I said, that&rsquo;s not possible because a blue moon is a second full moon
in the same month and that couldn&rsquo;t happen on 21 Nov.  It has to
happen at the very end of a month.  She pointed me at the above
article that explains it.</p>

<p>The short answer is that the two full moons in a month definition is
actually erroneous.</p>

<p>Rao notes that Lawrence J. Lafleur, in <em>Sky and Telescope</em> in 1943,
quotes a 1937 edition of the <em>Maine Farmer&rsquo;s Almanac</em>, stating that a
blue moon is the rare occurance of four full moons in a season instead
of three.  The blue moon is the third moon in that season.</p>

<p>The mistake was apparently made by James Hugh Pruett in a 1946 <em>Sky and
Telescope</em> where he misinterpreted Lafleur&rsquo;s explanation to mean a
second full moon in a single month.  (See the above article for
details).</p>

<p>The wrong explanation was propagated by Deborah Byrd in the radio
program &ldquo;Stardate&rdquo; in 1980 and then the wrong definition, quoting Rao,
&ldquo;went viral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It all makes me wonder when I first learned of the
two-full-moons-in-a-month definition.  I would have thought it was
long before 1980, but maybe it was after that date.</p>

<p>Well it sort of spoils the whole thing.  Now we&rsquo;ll have to talk about
old-correct-definition blue moons and new-incorrect-definition blue
moons and none of them will seem quite right any more.</p>

<p>This would all be a lot simpler if the moon would just actually turn
blue once in a while.</p>
