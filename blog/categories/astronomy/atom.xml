<p>The hyped story about the &ldquo;Super Moon&rdquo; is near the top of our on-line
news feeds.  I&rsquo;ll try to untangle the hype from some facts.  It&rsquo;s true
that this <em>full Moon</em> will be the closest since 1948-01-26.</p>

<p>The next closest super Moon will be in 2034, only four years before
our UNIX calendars run out of steam.</p>

<p>But how big a deal is this?  And what&rsquo;s really going on?</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Short version</h2>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to dive into the details below, here&rsquo;s the long
story short.  Every month the Moon is closer and farther from the
Earth as it follows its elliptical orbit.  Due to the tidal force from
the Sun, sometimes those distances are a little more extreme than
others.</p>

<p>The so-called  &ldquo;Super Moon&rdquo; occurs when the full Moon coincides very
closely with the Moon&rsquo;s closest approach, apogee, to the Earth for the
year.  But it&rsquo;s really only around 3% larger than any other close
approach during the year, and these happen every year.  They just
don&rsquo;t always occur when the Moon is almost exactly full.</p>

<h2>Kepler&rsquo;s first law</h2>

<p>Kepler&rsquo;s first law is that orbits have the shape of an ellipse with
the primary body at one of the two foci.  In this case the Earth is at
the focus.  The ellipse means the Moon moves closer to and farther
away from the Earth as it goes around.  It&rsquo;s closest point is called
the perigee, and the farthest point is the apogee.</p>

<h2>Sun&rsquo;s tidal forces</h2>

<p>Tidal forces stretch things.  The tidal force due to the Sun&rsquo;s and
Moon&rsquo;s gravity stretch the Earth&rsquo;s oceans so they have high points and
low points.  The tidal force of the Sun also stretches the Moon&rsquo;s
orbit.  When the Sun is in the direction of the long ellipse, the Sun
stretches it in a longer ellipse.  The extreme distances are even more
extreme:</p>

<p>apogee = 406,700 km, perigee = 356,400 km.</p>

<p>When the Sun is at right angles to the major axis, the orbit is pulled
into a less eccentric ellipse and the extremes are reduced.</p>

<p>apogee = 404,000 km, perigee = 370,400 km.</p>

<h2>Monthly motions</h2>

<p>Every month the Moon passes apogee and perigee as it orbits the
Earth.  In the excellent diagram above from the Wikipedia article on
the &ldquo;Orbit of the Moon,&rdquo; you can see the varying distance of the
Moon from the Earth plotted.  The minimum points are the perigee,
closest, distance.  Each month, when the Moon is at perigee, it will appear
a bit larger, than when it&rsquo;s farther away.</p>

<p>Notice how the minimum and maximum distances are not as extreme in
April as they are in August.  That&rsquo;s the Sun&rsquo;s tidal effect.</p>

<p>In this diagram, which was for 2014, it looks like the Moon was closest
to the Earth in about the second week of August at perigee.</p>

<h2>Moon phases</h2>

<p>The other thing in this diagram is the phase of the Moon.  The
diagonal lines show the Moon going from new (phase = 0) to full (phase
= 0.5) and back to new each month.  The vertical lines show when the
new Moons occur.</p>

<p>What we&rsquo;re really interested in here is the <em>full Moon</em> so it would
have been nice if there were vertical lines halfway in between the new
Moons to mark the phase = 0.5 full Moons.</p>

<h2>The big deal</h2>

<p>So now we have all the pieces to understand what the big deal is.
It&rsquo;s this.  How close does the full Moon come to the closest perigee
of the year?  Well, it almost never hits it perfectly, but it varies
from year to year.  In the year in the diagram, it looks like the
halfway full-Moon point would fall nearly on the mid-August closest
perigee.</p>

<p>Using the perigee-apogee calculator from below for 2014 we find the
full Moon hit the closest perigee on 2014-08-10 almost exactly, zero
hours difference!  The perigee distance was 356,896 km.</p>

<p>In contrast, this year they missed by about 2 hours on 2016-11-14 at a
distance of 356,511 km.  So the full Moon was off a bit, but the
closest perigee this year was a bit closer.  Why a bit closer?  It has
to do with the angle of the Sun to the ellipse of the Moon&rsquo;s orbit.</p>

<h2>But it isn&rsquo;t really</h2>

<p>So that timing of full Moon and closest perigee of the year is what
it&rsquo;s all about.  But notice that the Moon gets this close every year!
It&rsquo;s just not necessarily at, or exactly at, the time of the full
Moon.  Further, the Moon gets almost that close every month!</p>

<p>As we said above, the closet perigee distance is 356,400 km while the
farthest perigee is 370,400.  That&rsquo;s 3.93% larger from the farthest
perigee to closest.  That&rsquo;s how much the &ldquo;close&rdquo; Moon varies through
the year.</p>

<p>So where did the big 14% come from that I kept seeing in all of these
articles.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the difference in size between when the Moon is at apogee vs
perigee, and that happens every month, two weeks apart.  Actually it&rsquo;s
about 13.36% when the ellipse is stretched, and about 9.8% when it&rsquo;s
not.</p>

<p>So again, this happens <em>every</em> month, but just not when the Moon is
full.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brian Ventrudo writes about five classic telescopes in this article on
the <em>One-Minute Astronomer</em> blog.  Here&rsquo;s my own experience with these
instruments.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Unitron</h2>

<p>We had a 2.4 at the museum observatory and it was a
beautiful and delightful telescope.  I used it to observe, visually
via projection, the 1984 annular solar eclipse when I saw the Sun&rsquo;s
corona.</p>

<h2>Questar</h2>

<p>These portable little 3.5-inch Maksutovs were the beautiful jewels of
astronomy.  My planetarium and astronomical mentor, Mike Hood, has
collected Questars over the years.</p>

<h2>Celestron</h2>

<p>The leading Schmidt-Cassegrain brand ruled over our observatory.  We
had a 10-inch model identical to the one in Ventrudo&rsquo;s article.  It
was mounted on a permanent pier on the observatory floor.  There was
also the 14-in Celestron and two 8-inch models which I hauled around
to do observing programs.  I observed a large portion of the Messier
catalog on those 8-inches.</p>

<h2>RV-6 Dynascope</h2>

<p>The classic Criterion 6-in f/8 is a telescope I never owned or used
but I&rsquo;ve seen and looked through the RV-6.  I think there might have
been one added to the observatory collection after my time.  This
telescope and the corresponding Edmund Scientific 6-in f/8 Newtonian,
were the telescopes I dreamed most about in my early, teen astronomer
years.</p>

<h2>Coulter Dobs</h2>

<p>Dobsonian telescopes, which came to light around the turn of the
decade to 1980, changed amateur astronomy.  Large apertures became
affordable and usable.  I built my own 10-inch f/4.5 but bought the
optics from Coulter.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new trans-Neptunian object 2014 UZ224 has been annouced by the
discoverers.  It&rsquo;s orbit has a semi-major axis of 109 AU with a
current distance of 93 AU in the scattered disc.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Calla Cofield reports in Space.com,</p>

<blockquote><p>The dwarf planet, called 2014 UZ224, measures about 330 miles (530
kilometers) across and is located about 8.5 billion miles (13.7
billion km) from the sun, NPR reported today (Oct. 11). For
comparison, Pluto&rsquo;s largest moon, Charon, is about 750 miles (1,200
km) in diameter, and reaches a maximum distance of about 4.5 billion
miles (7.3 billion km) from the sun.</p>

<p>A year on 2014 UZ224 (the time it takes the dwarf planet to orbit the
sun) is about 1,100 Earth years. One Pluto year &hellip; is about 248
Earth years.</p></blockquote>

<p>The object was discovered using the Dark Energy Camera.</p>

<blockquote><p>A project called the Dark Energy Survey is using observations from the
DECam to create a map of the universe that provides information
relevant to the study of dark energy. The DES maps have already been
used to study dark matter (which makes up about eighty percent of all
the mass in the universe but whose exact nature is still a mystery)
and to find previously unidentified objects.</p>

<p>Part of the DES includes taking images of a few small patches of the
sky &ldquo;roughly&rdquo; once per week, according to the mission website, and
that&rsquo;s what made this new discovery possible.</p></blockquote>

<p>The interesting part of this article tells how undergraduate students
made the discovery by analyzing data with software they wrote.</p>

<p>Once again there&rsquo;s a minor crisis in naming.</p>

<blockquote><p>The smallest object in the solar system that has earned the title of
&ldquo;dwarf planet&rdquo; (prior to this new discovery) is Ceres, which lies in
the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars. Ceres is 590 miles (950
km) across. The object 2014 UZ224 might be too small to be considered
a dwarf planet, Gerdes told NPR, but that will have to be decided by
the International Astronomical Union (which made the controversial
decision to demote Pluto to a dwarf planet). There are four other
recognized dwarf planets in the solar system, but scientists think
there could be dozens — or even more than 100 — objects that size that
have yet to be discovered, according to NASA.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Distances</h2>

<p>I like it&rsquo;s easiest to think of solar system distances in terms of
light travel time from the sun.  It takes sunlight about eight minutes
to reach the Earth from the Sun.  It&rsquo;s 43 minutes to Jupiter, over
five hours to Pluto on average, and 15 hours to UZ224.</p>

<p>The chart below is based on the semi-major axis of each orbit which
you can think of as the average of the maximum and minimum distances
from the Sun.</p>

<pre><code>Earth     1.0 AU =      8.3 min
Jupiter   5.2 AU =     43   min
Neptune  30   AU =   4h10m
Pluto    39   AU =   5h25m
UZ224   109   AU =  15h08m
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brian Clark Howard at National Geographic writes that &ldquo;Our Part of the
Milky Way is Four Times Bigger Than We Thought.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- More -->


<blockquote><p>Published in the journal Science Advances this week, a new study
reported that our surrounding area of stars, gas, and dust—called the
Local Arm, Orion Spur, or Orion–Cygnus Arm—is actually about 20,000
light-years long.</p>

<p>The Local Arm is still considerably shorter than the Milky Way’s four
main arms, which wind around the galaxy&rsquo;s center for roughly 80,000
light-years. The total diameter of the galaxy is often reported as
about 100,000 light-years, although Reid says more recent evidence
suggests it is probably more like 70,000 light-years, at least to the
edge of where star density starts to really drop off.</p></blockquote>

<p>The abstract from the paper in &ldquo;Science Advances,&rdquo; &ldquo;The local spiral
structure of the Milky Way&rdquo; by Ye Xu, et al.</p>

<blockquote><p>The nature of the spiral structure of the Milky Way has long been
debated. Only in the last decade have astronomers been able to
accurately measure distances to a substantial number of high-mass
star-forming regions, the classic tracers of spiral structure in
galaxies. We report distance measurements at radio wavelengths using
the Very Long Baseline Array for eight regions of massive star
formation near the Local spiral arm of the Milky Way. Combined with
previous measurements, these observations reveal that the Local Arm is
larger than previously thought, and both its pitch angle and star
formation rate are comparable to those of the Galaxy’s major spiral
arms, such as Sagittarius and Perseus. Toward the constellation
Cygnus, sources in the Local Arm extend for a great distance along our
line of sight and roughly along the solar orbit. Because of this
orientation, these sources cluster both on the sky and in velocity to
form the complex and long enigmatic Cygnus X region. We also identify
a spur that branches between the Local and Sagittarius spiral arms.</p></blockquote>
