<p>Well, I&rsquo;m half way to having blogged for 30 days straight.  It&rsquo;s
required keeping up with it but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it so far.  The fact that
I&rsquo;ve thrown some re-tweets and link postings in there helps.  I like
the mid-length blogging ideas and those really fit my thinking.
Short, quick posts that say something you want to say are fine!</p>

<p>Some other takers of the 30 day challenge have been reflecting
mid-way.</p>

<p>Day 4</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Occasional reports on what in the world I’m doing. You can read here
to find out what I’ve been working on and how it’s going. There might
be clues about what I’m thinking. New things learned will also appear.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really not going to make all of these posts about blogging, I
promise.  However, I thought I should note this blog is now in it&rsquo;s
12th year.  I always miss the anniversary but it was this past month.
The first post was on Mon 2002-09-16 00:29 -0400.</p>

<p>In the beginning the posts were nearly all work-related reports on
what I was working on.  Then I began to include other topics I found
interesting such as astronomy and computing.</p>

<p>The first posts were written on Blogger, then still owned by Pyra
Labs, co-founded by Ev Williams who later was a co-founder of Twitter.
Google eventually bought Blogger.  I wrote the posts on Blogger but used
it&rsquo;s ftp publishing feature to push the generated pages back to my
desktop workstation, Monolith.</p>

<p>Monolith had an Apache web server running on it, upgraded from the
original NCSA HTTP server software at some point.  The computer had
originally been a NeXTstation then later it&rsquo;s soul had been migrated
to a Sun SPARC 5 workstation.  By this time, when the blog began in
2002, I think it might have been upgraded to a Sun Ultra 5 but I don&rsquo;t
recall the models and timeline precisely.</p>

<p>From Blogger, I migrated to Bloxom, then back to Blogger, fully hosted
at Blogspot, then recently to Octopress.  The pre-Octopress blog is
still on-line.</p>

    <link href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/12/octopress-after-512-days/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-12T23:10:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/12/octopress-after-512-days</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Day 2</p>

<p>Well, I was supposed to report back in on how it&rsquo;s been going with
Octopress after using it a while.  It&rsquo;s now been 512 days, or one year
and 147 days, or about 17 months which is about one year and five
months.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s basically been going okay.  The process isn&rsquo;t bad.  I put up
posts now and then with varying frequency.  Some are &ldquo;full&rdquo; posts with
picture and permission, some are occasionally long, and some are
short, ~tweet-length updates.</p>

<p>I like Octopress a lot.  The best part is writing in Markdown which
means my source files are all plain text and I have a copy of all of
them, so the blog is already in my possession and easily read without
any software or publishing.</p>

<p>The Octopress scripts are easy to use.  Right now I run a new_post
command to create a file, edit the file with Emacs, then re-generate
the blog and finally push the changes up to Github which is where I
publish it.</p>

<p>Adding an image is hardly more difficult than it was with Blogger.  I
have to download the image and get it into the machine I&rsquo;m writing
on.  Then it&rsquo;s just copying the image to a source directory in the
blog tree and adding one line to the Markdown file.</p>

<p>Yesterday, on Saturday I wrote the beginning of a Python script to
automate running those commands.  So far it handles it all up to
running Emacs on the created file.  Next will come updating the git
repo locally then pushing up the changes.</p>

<p>The biggest down side at the moment is that the archives are organized
in the single page view by date and year, but they aren&rsquo;t physically
organized in the real file tree.  Also there&rsquo;s no way to segment the
blog into archive pieces.  Generate, I think, rebuilds the whole site
basically and, as the site grows, it&rsquo;s taking a while to do a generate
now.  Okay, it takes 25 seconds but it seems like a long while.</p>

<p>As the archive grows to be years long, I believe it will become a big
unweildy.  It would be better if there was a way to segment off pieces
of the archive, e.g., each year, so you don&rsquo;t end up regenerating it
all every time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually pretty sure there is a way to do this, I&rsquo;ll just have to
dig it up when there&rsquo;s time.</p>
