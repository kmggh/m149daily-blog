<p><a href="/blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 19</a></p>

<p>Last night, while driving home, I stopped at an intersection where
work was being done on the traffic signals.  Looking at the open
control box I suddenly realized it was just a 19-inch rack inside the
silver box.  I think I even saw a network switch in there and a
surprising number of mounted devices.  That makes sense.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked around the standard 19-in racks in data centers for a long
time.  Even before that, when I was in school, it was common for a
physics lab to have a row of several 19-in racks.  They were usually
filled with instruments, controllers and maybe even an occasional
computer though microcomputers, small enough to fit in a rack, were
just beginning to appear on the scene.</p>

<p>Even large telescopes will have the standard racks mounted right on
the back of the telescope, like the 120-inch telescope here at the
Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/postimages/lick-120.jpg"></p>

<p>Where did they begin?  An on-line article &ldquo;Audio-Video Equipment
Racks&rdquo; credits Westinghouse.</p>

<blockquote><p>The origins of rack mounting dates to the days of industrialist George
Westinghouse way back in 1890. Westinghouse had first designed
19-inch shelving to house relay gear used in his railroad
industry. Eventually, early telephone companies also adopted this
19-inch width.</p></blockquote>

<p>For that reason they are sometimes called &ldquo;relay racks.&rdquo;  Wikipedia
says the relay rack name came from telephony and then appeared in
railroad signaling by 1911.</p>

<p>The Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) &ldquo;standardized them in its
310-D standard, first published in 1965.&rdquo;  That standard included the
1.75-in rack space height and the 19-in width (482.6 mm).</p>

<p>Wikipedia says,</p>

<blockquote><p>The 19-inch rack format with rack-units of 1.75 inches and holes
tapped for 12-24 screws with alternating spacings of 1.25 inches and
0.5 inch was an established standard by 1934. The EIA standard was
revised again in 1992 to comply with the 1988 public law 100-418,
setting the standard U as 44.5mm (15.9mm + 15.9mm + 12.7mm), making
each &ldquo;U&rdquo; officially 1.752 inches.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 9.1</a></p>

<p>There seems to be quite a controversy brewing over systemd.  I was
reading the debianfork.org site this morning and also the Wikipedia
page.  It seems to be a case of the old UNIX-way vs. a new,
re-engineered way of the functionality of the <em>init(8)</em>
process/program and how system booting and startup are managed.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t dug into this enough yet to understand all of the details of
the arguments.  The Wikipedia page makes it look like people with
names I know were, at least initially, agin it.</p>

<p>I currently favor the Linux 12.04 Server edition and I&rsquo;ll probably be
looking to upgrade to 16.04 at some point.  Will I be looking at some
alternative, new fork of Linux by then?  Or will I even be looking at
Linux at all?  That&rsquo;s a good question.  I may have two or three Mac
Minis by then and that will be it.  It could happen.  System
administration eventually gets old.</p>

<p>Mark Shuttleworth, the chief of Ubuntu, stamped the Debian decision on
2014-02-14 to go forward with Systemd.  I&rsquo;m not encouraged that his
post title begins with the word &ldquo;losing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Via <a href="https://twitter.com/slashdot/status/348387564174065665">@slashdot</a>.</p>

<p>Sixty-five Years Ago, Manchester&rsquo;s &lsquo;Baby&rsquo; Ran Electronically Stored Program. <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/13/06/22/0247220/65-years-ago-manchesters-baby-ran-electronically-stored-program?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Posting at Slashdot</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;as the Manchester Small Scale Experimental Machine aka &lsquo;Baby&rsquo; became
the world&rsquo;s first computer to run an electronically stored program on
June 21, 1948. The &lsquo;Baby&rsquo; was developed by Frederic C. Williams, Tom
Kilburn and Geoff Tootill at the University of Manchester.</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>From <a href="http://www.computer50.org/kgill/williams/williams.html">The Williams Tube</a> maintained by Brian Napper at the
University of Manchester.</p>

<blockquote><p>By March 1947 Tom Kilburn had discovered a different and better method
of storing information, more suited to storing a large number of bits
on the same tube. By November 1947 they had succeeded in storing 2048
bits for a period of hours, having investigated a number of variations
on storing a set of bits (dot-dash, dash-dot, defocus-focus,
focus-defocus).</p>

<p>The general principle behind the storage of binary information was to
plant charge in one of two different ways at an array of spots on a
CRT using standard techniques. The type of charge at any spot,
representing a 0 or 1, could be sensed by a metal pick-up plate on the
outside of the CRT screen, thus &ldquo;reading&rdquo; the &ldquo;value&rdquo; of the
spot. However, the charge dissipated very quickly, so values were
preserved indefinitely by continuously reading their value and
resetting the charge as appropriate to the value.</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>When in Autumn 1947 the group had successfully stored 2048 digits,
they had the problem of proving that the store would operate
successfully inside a computer. They could only alter bits at the rate
of around 1 a second, which was 100,000 times slower than the store&rsquo;s
capability. In the end they decided that the simplest way to test that
the CRT storage system was suitable for use in computers was to build
a small computer round it. So the way was clear for the construction
of the SSEM, the &ldquo;Baby&rdquo;, &ldquo;to subject the system to the most searching
test possible.&rdquo; The Baby was therefore built to show that
Williams-Kilburn CRT Stores could work dynamically in a working
computer, and to demonstrate the feasibility of building a much larger
machine using them. That it also was the first machine to realise the
stored-program computer, and prove its feasibility was a secondary
consideration.</p></blockquote>
