<p>There seems to be quite a controversy brewing over systemd.  I was
reading the debianfork.org site this morning and also the Wikipedia
page.  It seems to be a case of the old UNIX-way vs. a new,
re-engineered way of the functionality of the <em>init(8)</em>
process/program and how system booting and startup are managed.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t dug into this enough yet to understand all of the details of
the arguments.  The Wikipedia page makes it look like people with
names I know were, at least initially, agin it.</p>

<p>I currently favor the Linux 12.04 Server edition and I&rsquo;ll probably be
looking to upgrade to 16.04 at some point.  Will I be looking at some
alternative, new fork of Linux by then?  Or will I even be looking at
Linux at all?  That&rsquo;s a good question.  I may have two or three Mac
Minis by then and that will be it.  It could happen.  System
administration eventually gets old.</p>

<p>Mark Shuttleworth, the chief of Ubuntu, stamped the Debian decision on
2014-02-14 to go forward with Systemd.  I&rsquo;m not encouraged that his
post title begins with the word &ldquo;losing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sixty-five Years Ago, Manchester&rsquo;s &lsquo;Baby&rsquo; Ran Electronically Stored Program. <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/13/06/22/0247220/65-years-ago-manchesters-baby-ran-electronically-stored-program?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Posting at Slashdot</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;as the Manchester Small Scale Experimental Machine aka &lsquo;Baby&rsquo; became
the world&rsquo;s first computer to run an electronically stored program on
June 21, 1948. The &lsquo;Baby&rsquo; was developed by Frederic C. Williams, Tom
Kilburn and Geoff Tootill at the University of Manchester.</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>From <a href="http://www.computer50.org/kgill/williams/williams.html">The Williams Tube</a> maintained by Brian Napper at the
University of Manchester.</p>

<blockquote><p>By March 1947 Tom Kilburn had discovered a different and better method
of storing information, more suited to storing a large number of bits
on the same tube. By November 1947 they had succeeded in storing 2048
bits for a period of hours, having investigated a number of variations
on storing a set of bits (dot-dash, dash-dot, defocus-focus,
focus-defocus).</p>

<p>The general principle behind the storage of binary information was to
plant charge in one of two different ways at an array of spots on a
CRT using standard techniques. The type of charge at any spot,
representing a 0 or 1, could be sensed by a metal pick-up plate on the
outside of the CRT screen, thus &ldquo;reading&rdquo; the &ldquo;value&rdquo; of the
spot. However, the charge dissipated very quickly, so values were
preserved indefinitely by continuously reading their value and
resetting the charge as appropriate to the value.</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>When in Autumn 1947 the group had successfully stored 2048 digits,
they had the problem of proving that the store would operate
successfully inside a computer. They could only alter bits at the rate
of around 1 a second, which was 100,000 times slower than the store&rsquo;s
capability. In the end they decided that the simplest way to test that
the CRT storage system was suitable for use in computers was to build
a small computer round it. So the way was clear for the construction
of the SSEM, the &ldquo;Baby&rdquo;, &ldquo;to subject the system to the most searching
test possible.&rdquo; The Baby was therefore built to show that
Williams-Kilburn CRT Stores could work dynamically in a working
computer, and to demonstrate the feasibility of building a much larger
machine using them. That it also was the first machine to realise the
stored-program computer, and prove its feasibility was a secondary
consideration.</p></blockquote>
