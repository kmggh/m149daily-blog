    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The latest rage is all about the block chain, made popular by Bitcoin.
It&rsquo;s not exactly authentication but more publication of data in a
sense that it becomes part of a sequential public record.  From that
point on, it can be looked up and verified.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>The clever part is that the public record isn&rsquo;t posted in a particular
place or location but is distributed all over, approximately to
everyone who cares.  Since everyone has a copy, they can be verified
against each other.</p>

<p>As pointed out in the article below, it&rsquo;s like publishing a snippet
about a transaction in a newspaper which is then sent out to all
subscribers.  In this case, though, the newspaper contains all of the
transactions ever published there and just keeps adding to them.  You
can see one of the first problems right there.  This growing &ldquo;ledger&rdquo;
just keeps, well, growing.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem to scale well as they say.</p>

<blockquote><p>As an AWS Cloud Consultant I see many AWS accounts. During the year I
collected mistakes that I saw in each account and aggregated them to
provide you my best of. It turned out that the 5 most common mistakes
on AWS are:</p>

<ul>
<li>managing infrastructure manually</li>
<li>not using Auto Scaling Groups</li>
<li>not analyzing metrics in CloudWatch</li>
<li>ignoring Trusted Advisor</li>
<li>underutilizing virtual machines</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These are fascinating little computer boards and boxes that seem
perfect for making firewalls and such.  Boards are available with
three gigabit ethernet ports.  Prices are in the $100 range and there
is  support for Linux, e.g., Ubuntu.  Steve Gibson mentioned them on
Security Now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve finally upgraded to Mac OS X 10.11 at home.  There&rsquo;s really not
much to say so far.  The only new/changed feature I really see and use
is Mission Control.  Ohter than that it&rsquo;s pretty much business as
usual.</p>

<p>The process went quite smoothly.  I started the download and left it
unattended.  Then I returned later and started the install and left it
running unattended.  Note that I usually never leave an upgrade
running but they did take a few minutes and I had other things to do
including even being out of the house for a while.</p>

<p>When I came back and the new login screen was presented I logged in
with no trouble and only had to enter the Apple id for iCloud.</p>

<p>There may be features I&rsquo;m using that are new or changed and I haven&rsquo;t
used them enough in the past so I&rsquo;m unaware of the differences.</p>

<p>I hear that Notes has become quite good but I&rsquo;m sticking with Evernote
and Drafts on my phone.</p>
