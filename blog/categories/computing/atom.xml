week explaining what&rsquo;s happening when lithium ion batteries fail.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>From Paul O’Shea, Editor, <em>Power Electronics News</em> interviewing Nadim
Maluf, CEO of Qnovo, and Robert Nalesnik, VP of Marketing for Qnovo.</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, let’s examine one particular manufacturing defect in which a
slight misalignment between the anode and cathode occurs during the
assembly process. The same structure as above now has the anode layer
shifted slightly to the right. At the misaligned edge, the requisite
overlap of the anode relative to the cathode is now diminished or even
possibly eliminated. The anode/cathode ratio at this spot drops below
the requisite limit for ensuring safety. The result is the onset of
lithium metal at this edge. The lithium metal forms on the anode
edge. As the lithium metal grows in size and thickness, it ultimately
punctures the separator and causes an electrical short between the
anode and cathode. Boom! There is a catastrophic failure.</p>

<p>The tolerance requirements in the manufacturing of lithium-ion
batteries have risen sharply with increasing energy density. Short of
using new materials (which still do not exist in commercial
deployment), increasing the energy density means reducing all the
extra space inside the battery that is not made of anode and cathode
materials. These are the only two materials that store energy;
n> everything else is just overhead. They are still needed for other
functions and safety, but they do not contribute to storing electrical
charge. Therefore, battery designers keep reducing this overhead and,
in the process, make the manufacturing tolerances even tighter. That
is a recipe for many disasters to come unless we start adding a lot
more intelligence to the battery to avoid and mitigate these
undesired situations.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is why I only buy Lightning cables, chargers and batteries for
Apple products from the Apple Store.  It&rsquo;s just too risky to buy them
anywhere else.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>It&rsquo;s been known for a long time that cheaply made Lithium Ion
batteries are very dangerous and will short, catch fire and burn.  Now
Samsung has made this abundantly clear.</p>

<p>Ben Lovejoy of <em>9to5 Mac</em> writes &ldquo;More than 90% of &lsquo;genuine&rsquo; Apple
chargers &amp; cables sold on Amazon are fake, says Apple.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>There’s no shortage of third-party chargers and cables sold for Apple
equipment, some of them claiming to be the genuine article, but Apple
has found that even Amazon has been selling counterfeit products
labelled as the real thing. The products concerned were sold by Amazon
directly, and not by a third-party Marketplace seller.</p>

<p>The items have now been removed from sale, and Apple is suing the
company that made them …</p></blockquote>

<p>Amazon responded.</p>

<blockquote><p>Amazon responded, stating that the company ‘has zero tolerance for the
sale of counterfeits on our site.  We work closely with manufacturers
and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively.’</p>

<p>Given the number of fake Apple products available, we always urge
caution where the price is significantly lower than the official
price. This is especially true in the case of MagSafe power supplies,
where any price lower than available from authorized resellers is an
immediate warning flag.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The information world is a dangerous place these days.  You can lose
everything in an instant.  There&rsquo;s more at stake.  The biggest one is
probably your personal and family pictures.  The next is personal
financial and other important information, documents, etc.  I don&rsquo;t
know if it&rsquo;s any more dangerous but more of us have more important
information stored on our computers and other devices.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my own list of the basics.  There&rsquo;s nothing original here.  You
should hear about the same thing from any security or IT professional.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t open links and attachments in email, messages</li>
<li>Keep systems and apps, everything, updated</li>
<li>Keep Internet browsing on Main Street</li>
<li>Make backups, 3, 2, 1 (three copies, two media, one off site)</li>
<li>Use Google Chrome</li>
<li>Use Gmail</li>
<li>Use a password manager like LastPass or 1Password</li>
<li>Never install something you weren&rsquo;t looking for</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Basics</h2>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t open links and attachments in email, messages</h3>

<p>This is one of the biggest threats today.  You click a link and
download an attachment and you&rsquo;ve given malware, an attacking computer
program, access to <em>your</em> computer.  Fortunately most of our systems
today are secure enough that they can&rsquo;t be compromised unless you take
the action yourself so the game is to trick you into running the
evil code.  Sending you email that looks like a legitimate, important
message from your bank or the IRS, or maybe telling you you&rsquo;ve won
something or have an important message, maybe an unpaid bill.</p>

<p>If the message is from a bank or some institution or business, see if
you can get to the same information by going to their web site on your
own, not by clicking in the email, and finding what they&rsquo;re talking
about.  If nothing else, call them.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s from a family member, text them or call them and ask if they
sent it to you and if they&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s okay.</p>

<p>Many of the largest company security breaches in recent news have been
the result of finally tricking an employee to click on something in an
email message.</p>

<h3>Keep systems and apps, everything, updated</h3>

<p>All software and, in fact, most hardware, is updated regularly.  These
updates are important.  Many people are working hard to find and fix
bugs that could expose you to attack.   On Windows, Mac OS, and Linux,
you should turn on automatic updates so your system is updated on a
regular basis.</p>

<h3>Keep Internet browsing on Main Street</h3>

<p>This means stick to well known and reputable sites: people,
businesses, destinations.  Don&rsquo;t go down the side streets of the
Internet and definitely don&rsquo;t stray into any dark alleys.  As in real
life, it only leads to trouble.</p>

<h2>Make backups, 3, 2, 1</h2>

<p>That means three copies, two media, one off site.  This may be the
second most important thing you can do, maybe the first.  First, this
is just basic data stewardship.  It&rsquo;s gives you the best chance of not
losing it all.  However, with the recent, dramatic rise in ransom
ware, backups are even more important.  Ransom ware gets into your
computer (e.g., by getting you to click a link in email) and encrypts
all of your files.  Then you have to pay a web site anywhere from $100
to $1000 for a key to unlock your files.  There&rsquo;s no other way to get
them back.  However, if you have a recent enough backup then you can
ignore the ransom ware attackers, wipe your computer clean and
restore your files.</p>

<p>Here is the simplest way to do this.  Buy a second, external USB hard
drive which should cost from $60 to $90, attach it to your computer
and use a program that backs up your files to it nightly.  Then
subscribe to a service like Carbonite or Back Blaze. They both charge
about $5 per month.</p>

<h2>Use Google Chrome</h2>

<p>As Internet browsers go, Chrome is the most secure.  This is proven
often and Chrome was the clear winner at this year&rsquo;s annual &ldquo;Pwn to
own&rdquo;
security contest, as it usually is.  Chrome isn&rsquo;t perfect but it will
help keep you safe.</p>

<h2>Use Gmail</h2>

<p>Gmail is the best email period and it&rsquo;s also very safe and will work
hard to help keep you secure.  It&rsquo;s also not perfect, though, so you
still have to follow all of the other guidelines here.  I&rsquo;ve used
Gmail since it came out in 2004, that&rsquo;s 12 years, and it&rsquo;s sad when I
hear people talk about email problems and issues that I haven&rsquo;t even
thought about for those 12 years.</p>

<h2>Use a password manager</h2>

<p>Maybe the two biggest are LastPass and 1Password.  I personally prefer
LastPass but pretty much everything I say here about LastPass applies
to 1Password as well.  You put all of your passwords into LastPass for
everything you use.  If you install it into your browser, it will log
into sites for you automatically.  Make sure every site has a
<em>different</em> and <em>long</em> password, at least 25 characters, usually with
a mixture of upper case, lower case, numerals, and other special
characters.  Lastpass will make up new passwords for you.  Remember,
you won&rsquo;t be typing in these passwords.  Lastpass will do that for
you.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good practice to use a different user name for each site and it
can also be a random jumble of letters.  Similarly, if you have to
answer security questions for the site, use a jumble of letters for
that.  In other words, don&rsquo;t put your mother&rsquo;s maiden name as &ldquo;Smith&rdquo;
but enter it as &ldquo;GAStiOnOgyRiVEnDETorpoyaL&rdquo;.  Use different answers
for every site.  Put them in the Notes section of that account on
LastPass.</p>

<p>There is one important thing:  Lastpass (and 1Password) uses a master
password to unlock access by you to the rest of your passwords.  You
should make the master password easy to remember and key in, but also
be absolutely sure to write it down and store it in a non-obvious,
very safe place.</p>

<h2>Never install something you weren&rsquo;t looking for</h2>

<p>This is a rule from Steve Gibson of GRC.com and Security Now.  If you
get a pop up message on your computer that says it&rsquo;s time to install
an update or something else, don&rsquo;t do it.  It could be fine, but don&rsquo;t
take the chance.  This is what we mean by &ldquo;something you weren&rsquo;t
looking for.&rdquo;   Instead of clicking on the popup, go to the actual
application or go to the web site and see if you can find whatever the
popup was talking about there.  Maybe go to your system&rsquo;s app store
and see if there are pending updates there.</p>

<h2>What about virus software?</h2>

<p>Did you notice I didn&rsquo;t mention virus software or anything to remove
adware or malware.  Those days are pretty much over.  The types of
attacks and the real problems usually aren&rsquo;t viruses any more.  If you
have Windows, turn on Microsoft&rsquo;s own, built in virus scanning.  It&rsquo;s
sufficient and free.  You definitely don&rsquo;t need anything scanning your
email or web connections, especially if you use Chrome and Gmail.</p>

<p>I do use ad blocking software, Ghostery on the desktop.  I&rsquo;m not
qualified to recommend which ad blocking software is best right now.
Anyway, ad blocking is more about avoiding browsing nuisances of ads
covering a web page you&rsquo;re trying to read and are not so much a
security matter.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll soon follow up with part 2, Bonus Tips.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a re-post of a blog post I wrote on 2004-08-31 17:48 on
Monolith Daily about an idea of pocket computing that Jim K and I had.
I&rsquo;ve made a couple of minor grammatical corrections.</em></p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Computing in the Future</h2>

<p>One day while walking in a mall, c. 1982, the idea of the tablet
computer suddenly became very clear to me. It wasn&rsquo;t an original idea,
I&rsquo;m sure. I wasn&rsquo;t exactly aware of Alan Kaye&rsquo;s ideas at the time, as
far as I know, but I was always impressed by the newspads in Arthur
C. Clarke&rsquo;s <em>2001: A Space Odyssey.</em>
I had the full vision of a notepad-sized computer which would replace
computers, books, HBO, and a portable music device.</p>

<p><em>[Added Note:  I had read the book</em> The Mote In God&rsquo;s Eye <em>by Larry Niven and
 Jerry Pournelle but didn&rsquo;t remember that it also contained the idea
 of a pocket computer.]</em></p>

<p>In recent years I&rsquo;ve watched DVD movies and digital videos on a laptop
and I&rsquo;ve seen actual tablets finally come into use by people around me
in the office.</p>

<p>Today, in a discussion with Jim K, we had another vision that seems to
be a reasonable direction for computing. Again, I doubt
this is original and this certainly could be something that we&rsquo;ve read
somewhere. Some of these ideas have probably floated around Xerox PARC
for years and even Alvin Toffler, in Future Shock wrote about everyone
carrying around a little personal computer/information device. (Also I
know that some of these ideas, particularly about wireless access like
Blue Tooth, have been around for a while and even implemented.)</p>

<h3>A &ldquo;Pocket Computer,&rdquo; Literally</h3>

<p>Think of the &ldquo;key-chain&rdquo; digital drives that have recently become
popular. These are little fob-sized devices that plug into a USB port.
Now, for the maybe-not-so-distant future, imagine a device about that
size that has a whole computer built into it. This computer has
memory, a fast CPU and wireless connectivity over a short range (say
less than a meter or so), similar to Blue Tooth. You can just carry
this computer around in your pocket.</p>

<h3>The Desktop</h3>

<p>On your desk is simply a keyboard and flat panel. When you sit down at
your desk, your pocket computer automatically finds and links to your
keyboard and screen. Voila! You have a desktop computer.</p>

<p>This happens when you walk up to any desk top screen and
keyboard. (There are appropriate security measures of course, so just
any device can&rsquo;t grab your system).</p>

<h3>A Laptop?</h3>

<p>Notice there&rsquo;s no need for a laptop. You can carry around a tablet of
sorts which is just an I/O device (display, pad, and maybe
keyboard). When you activate this tablet, it links to your pocket
computer.</p>

<p>The same is true for a PDA. Again, this only needs to be an active I/O
device.</p>

<p>Add a linkable headset and you have a iPod-like device.</p>

<h3>Really Portable</h3>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to carry a laptop home. All you do is get up from your
desk and leave.</p>

<p>When you get home and sit down in front of your desktop
screen-keyboard-mouse station, your pocket computer links and
activates it.</p>

<h3>A New Sneakernet</h3>

<p>Though sending output to a printer via the typical, networked way
still has advantages, imagine printing a document so that it&rsquo;s spooled
onto your pocket computer. You get up and walk to a printer. Your
computer finds the printer, links to it and the printer prints your
pages. (Yeah I know, this is an old idea).</p>

<h3>It&rsquo;s All About Storage</h3>

<p>These pocket devices would primarily be storage devices that just
happen to have computers grafted onto them because the computers are
so cheap and tiny, they are inconsequential. If you need more storage,
you buy a new keychain-sized device and throw it into your pocket. You
get another computer for free.</p>

<p>With a little direction from you, the new device and old device could
find each other and either transfer your files to the new one or link
themselves together into storage/computing array.</p>

<h3>Clusters galore</h3>

<p>Throw several pocket computers in your pocket. They could link
themselves together into a redundant storage array. Or into a
computing cluster. Or both simultaneously.</p>

<p>Fill a bucket with them and you have a high-performance computing
cluster. They decide how to link themselves together in a useful
topology.</p>

<h3>Backups</h3>

<p>With a pocket computer set up to be a backup device, whenever your
pocket computer finds this &ldquo;backup buddy,&rdquo; it makes copies of all
changed files. I think I&rsquo;d keep a backup buddy on the dresser and one
in a desk drawer at the office.</p>

<p>If your pocket device fails, just grab a backup buddy and and it
becomes your new &ldquo;master.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>ID, Security Badges, Wallets and Keys</h3>

<p>Such pocket computers could fill the roll of smart id badges (doors
unlock for you automatically because the device identifies you).</p>

<p>They could be your electronic wallet. When you walk out of a store
with a cart of goods, your pocket computer could check you out and pay
for you. It could link to a display on the cart so you could confirm
the purchases and okay the payment.</p>

<p>Your pocket computer could even start your car, and unlock your house.</p>

<p>(It could require some input from you so that just anyone that picks
it up didn&rsquo;t have access to everything).</p>

<h3>Books</h3>

<p>When you pick up a book reader (if it&rsquo;s different from a tablet), the
pocket computer would link in to give you access to books it stored.</p>

<h3>Other Media</h3>

<p>To buy media (music, movies, books, software) at a store you just
select the media you want to buy and they are automatically downloaded
to your pocket computer. If you buy them on-line, they are downloaded
to your pocket computer from there.</p>

<h3>On-line Access</h3>

<p>When you are near a network access point, your pocket computer links
in and connects you to the Internet.</p>

<h3>Your Watch?</h3>

<p>Just a linked display.</p>

<h3>Do You Want to Play a Game?</h3>

<p>Your kid sits down in your room with friends, with your wireless game
controllers (with displays), and all your pocket computers link
together in a network. With the right game software, you can all play
a shared game.
Software Distribution</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s one way to do it. This is actually an old idea but with fast
enough and convenient enough I/O, it might become feasible.</p>

<p>You buy your software on-line and it&rsquo;s stored on a central
service. Your whole computing environment is virtual and on-line. When
you want to use a new pocket computer, it links to an on-line access
point and downloads all of your software. This lets you install your
software transparently, including moving it to a new pocket device.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to worry about media or proof of purchase.</p>

<h3>Security Notes</h3>

<p>Of course security for such a device would be critically
important. You should be able to register devices you allow it to link
to. This could be a white list and black list approach. Such a device
could work like a child and ask, &ldquo;Can I link to that device?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not that one. That&rsquo;s a stranger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Or, you could simply say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me about linking to anyone
else. I&rsquo;ll tell you when you can!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Where do these crazy ideas come from?</h3>

<p>First, computers are shrinking. I don&rsquo;t think anything I&rsquo;ve described
above needs more CPU power and memory than we have today. If computer
technology continues to shrink the processor, then the power we have
now will grow smaller.</p>

<p>Server class machines are shrinking now to card-sized blades so
desktop systems will continue to shrink, too.</p>

<p>Wireless is becoming more and more common, from cell phones that link
to each other with Blue Tooth, to wireless LANs, to wireless keyboards
and mice.</p>

<p>Storage continues to shrink. We have solid state storage today, in our
cameras, in our iPods, and in our keychain drives.</p>

<p>When computers shrink to become smaller than the storage device, and
cheaper, an interesting thing happens. In the past, we used floppies,
CDs and removing hard storage devices to move information from one
computer to another (when not just transferring over a communications
channel of some kind). What if the computer is small enough to be
built into the storage device? -—cheap enough so that every storage
device has it&rsquo;s own computer?</p>

<h3>Some problems to overcome</h3>

<p>One problem you would have to solve is power. The little pocket
computer needs a good battery. Batteries are shrinking and getting
better (look at cell phones).</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p><em>One thing I clearly didn&rsquo;t anticipate in 2004 was the smart phone in
 its recent form.  It&rsquo;s actually played most of these roles.  It
 hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me how powerful an attached, high-resolution
 display screen would be.</em></p>

<p><em>There&rsquo;s also one wireless technology that we still don&rsquo;t have,
really.  Did you catch it?  We can&rsquo;t wirelessly connect a device to a
high-resolution monitor. Yes, we have &ldquo;cast&rdquo; capability but that&rsquo;s to
a receiver plugged into the display. I can&rsquo;t play a movie on my phone
and have it display in HD on the TV withouth plugging an HDMI cable
into my phone.</em></p>
