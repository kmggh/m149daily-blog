    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From the web site High Scalability is a nice article on scaling a
service on Amazon Web Services from one to over 11 million users.
It&rsquo;s based on a talk by Joel Williams from AWS.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>He lists  these main points.</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>Start with SQL and only move to NoSQL when necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>A consistent theme is take components and separate them out. This
allows those components to scale and fail independently. It applies to
breaking up tiers and creating microservices.</p></li>
<li><p>Only invest in tasks that differentiate you as a business, don&rsquo;t
reinvent the wheel.</p></li>
<li><p>Scalability and redundancy are not two separate concepts, you can
often do both at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>There&rsquo;s no mention of costs. That would be a good addition to the talk
as that is one of the major criticisms of AWS solutions.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The section for just one user is also quite helpful.</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>Run on a single instance, maybe a type t2.micro. Instance types
comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking
capacity and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of
resources for your applications.</p></li>
<li><p>The one instance would run the entire web stack, for example: web app,
database, management, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Use Amazon Route 53 for the DNS.</p></li>
<li><p>Attach a single Elastic IP address to the instance.</p></li>
</ul>

    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2016/01/08/block-chain-for-authentication</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The latest rage is all about the block chain, made popular by Bitcoin.
It&rsquo;s not exactly authentication but more publication of data in a
sense that it becomes part of a sequential public record.  From that
point on, it can be looked up and verified.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>The clever part is that the public record isn&rsquo;t posted in a particular
place or location but is distributed all over, approximately to
everyone who cares.  Since everyone has a copy, they can be verified
against each other.</p>

<p>As pointed out in the article below, it&rsquo;s like publishing a snippet
about a transaction in a newspaper which is then sent out to all
subscribers.  In this case, though, the newspaper contains all of the
transactions ever published there and just keeps adding to them.  You
can see one of the first problems right there.  This growing &ldquo;ledger&rdquo;
just keeps, well, growing.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem to scale well as they say.</p>

<blockquote><p>As an AWS Cloud Consultant I see many AWS accounts. During the year I
collected mistakes that I saw in each account and aggregated them to
provide you my best of. It turned out that the 5 most common mistakes
on AWS are:</p>

<ul>
<li>managing infrastructure manually</li>
<li>not using Auto Scaling Groups</li>
<li>not analyzing metrics in CloudWatch</li>
<li>ignoring Trusted Advisor</li>
<li>underutilizing virtual machines</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These are fascinating little computer boards and boxes that seem
perfect for making firewalls and such.  Boards are available with
three gigabit ethernet ports.  Prices are in the $100 range and there
is  support for Linux, e.g., Ubuntu.  Steve Gibson mentioned them on
Security Now.</p>
