    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, in my earlier post on security tips I mentioned links in email.
According to an article in <em>Business Insider</em>, that&rsquo;s exactly how John
Podesta&rsquo;s account was compromised.</p>

<!-- More -->


<blockquote><p>Simply put: Rather than clicking a legitimate link from Google, he
apparently clicked through to a fake website run by hackers. When he
entered his account information, he handed over the keys to his
Gmail.</p></blockquote>

<p>This article by Ben Gilbert goes into some detail about how this was
done.  It was an easy effort by the attacker and could have been
avoided with a bit more care on the part of the user.  He even did the
right thing in reporting it to his IT support but still clicked the
dangerous link in the email.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Email isn&rsquo;t just for direct communication but it can be used for
notifications, too.  I can put up a blog post or two and then send a brief
email message to a list of friends and family with the links.  This ia
actually a method of using sender-stored email where the blog post
becomes the sender-stored message and the notification is via the
email notice.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Beyond notifications, it&rsquo;s a way to stay in touch with an exact set of
family and friends which is otherwise hard to do.  That&rsquo;s because some
are on Facebook, some on Twitter, maybe even on Google+?  Nah,
probably not Google+.  Who knows, but I think email is still
universal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a reposting of a bit I wrote on Fri 2015-05-29.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gone round and round trying to sort out what&rsquo;s the ideal
communication solution.  For now I&rsquo;ve come back to the simple answer:
email.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>I thought email was over, that it was time to leave it behind,
relegated to just handling commercial spam and first-contact
messages.  However, in searching for some replacement that made sense,
that had a simpler storage architecture, HTTP-only transport, and so
forth, I haven&rsquo;t found a simple solution.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still true that sender-stored email is an ideal solution, but it
requires the <em>sender</em> to do the work.  It even works, at least when
<em>I&rsquo;m</em> the sender.  However, replies and conversations are a bit more
difficult with sender-stored email than with regular email.</p>

<p>The indie web and micro-formats are also interesting moves in this
direction, but they also represent a lot of work for the participant.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Gmail ends up being an implementation that has nearly all
of the properties of any of the replacements I can imagine,
particularly when all participants are actually on Gmail.  In that
case it is all secure HTTPS to the service, storage is secure and you
can get your data out if you want to leave Gmail.</p>

<ul>
<li>One to one is straightforward.</li>
<li>One to many is BCC.</li>
<li>Many to one is straightforward.</li>
</ul>


<p>And, it turns out that Gmail in it&rsquo;s native format is very
lightweight.  My recent move toward eliminating signing messages and
removing the signature makes it nearly identical to a simple chat.
Gmail&rsquo;s presentation keeps that view clean.</p>

<p>Gmail&rsquo;s Inbox moves a couple of steps closer to the clean and simple
ideal, but then it leaves other features hard to use.  Inbox
superimposes a todo list view on the email that&rsquo;s unwanted, with the
slight redeeming quality that it does provide a way to keep the inbox
looking clean and minimal.  My recent problem with Inbox, which I&rsquo;m
using for kenguyton@gmail.com, was that I had two unread messages that
I simply could not find on the phone app even though it had a badge
saying two items were there, somewhere!  Fortunately, going back to
Inbox on the desktop showed them right up top.  There seems to be some
bug in that system, maybe in the phone-desktop interaction.</p>

<p>So, for now, I&rsquo;m going back to basics.  Email.  I&rsquo;d never have
believed it.</p>

<p>That said, I do use phone text messaging, and more specifically,
iMessage on the iPhone, for the majority of my family communication.
I use Facebook messages and Facebook for some.  I&rsquo;ve never done more
than play with direct messages on Twitter.  We use Hipchat at work
which I dislike a lot.  That model is wrong in several ways. My
biggest complaint there is that Messages aren&rsquo;t threaded.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For some reason, the chat paradigm has become overly popular.  Internet
relay chat (IRC) was interesting in the mid-90s as a way to
communicate in an informal, unstructured sense.  However, I can&rsquo;t
believe it&rsquo;s still so popular.  Then we have Hipchat, Slack and
others.  What&rsquo;s the deal?</p>

<p>What is the utility of an endless scroll of mixed up and confused,
uncollated, blended conversations with no good way to determine their
topics or context?</p>

<p>Maybe it is the valid rebellion against email.  I thought for a while
that email had reached the end of its usefulness.  However, in my own
personal quest for a substitute, I&rsquo;ve reluctantly come to the
conclusion that email is the only workable, reliable solution.</p>

<p>Granted phone text messages are how I normally communicate with my
family.  Beyond my immediate family, family and friends are all on
Facebook.  One or two people still seem to use Google+ and, of course,
most Google employees.</p>

<p>Email has subjects, labels and excellent search.  It accommodates
messages of any length, including super short.</p>

<p>I do like the idea of minimal email and Google Inbox makes a valiant
attempt but I expect it to be squashed any minute as is the end of all
Google services, useful or not.  Ultimately, the native, plain
old Gmail is actually quite minimal when you really look at it.  Each
message in a conversation has the names of the people, a picture of
the sender and the message.  It looks like chat.</p>

<p>One personal change I&rsquo;ve made quietly over the past few months is to
drop all signatures including just signing my name on email messages.
The truth is we still have a compulsion to write an email message like
a letter or office memo, and not like a tweet or chat snippet.  I&rsquo;ll
still write in complete, hopefully correct, sentences with correct
spelling.  When corresponding with someone I don&rsquo;t often send email
to, then I&rsquo;m less familiar and will include my first name or full name
and maybe even a signature if it&rsquo;s a business message.</p>

    <link href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2015/03/23/gmail-inbox-mistake/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-23T08:13:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2015/03/23/gmail-inbox-mistake</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, that was a mistake.  To a large degree I really like Gmail&rsquo;s new
Inbox IOS app, and the desktop version doesn&rsquo;t look bad either.  I&rsquo;ve
used it on a rarely-used account and recently added in anther,
more-often-used account so I could try out more interaction.  I heard
someone on a podcast say, It doesn&rsquo;t really affect your regular Gmail
interface interactions so you can use both at the same time.  That
seemed to be the case to me, so I thought, okay, I&rsquo;ll just fire it up
on my main Gmail account.</p>

<p>That was a mistake.</p>

<p>So it does have an effect in a particular way.  I should have seen
it.  The Gmail model is to treat messages like to do items and mark
them as &ldquo;Done&rdquo; when you are finished with them, instead of marking
them as &ldquo;Read.&rdquo;  Marking as &ldquo;Read&rdquo; is still there but it&rsquo;s
independent.  Of course, &ldquo;Done&rdquo; is yet another label though it doesn&rsquo;t
show up in the list of labels so maybe it&rsquo;s more a kind of state.
However, you can search in the regular Gmail for &ldquo;label:done&rdquo; and it
will find your done messages.  (That&rsquo;s giving away the ending).</p>

<p>With the Inbox app, you can go through and use the little &ldquo;sweep&rdquo;
icons to sweep away large collections of messages as &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; all in
one, uh, swoop.  Fortunately, it didn&rsquo;t seem to let me do more than
one month at a time.  I finally got tired of that, but then went back
to check the Gmail view.</p>

<p>My mistake was thinking &ldquo;Done&rdquo; in the Inbox app meant &ldquo;mark as Read&rdquo;
in the Gmail app, which was wrong.  So I&rsquo;d moved hundreds of messages
out of my Inbox to who knows where.  Well now we all know they no
longer had the Inbox label and now had the Done label or state.  (And,
yes, I&rsquo;m now going to stop using the quotes around all of these states
and labels).  Also, as we all should know, in Gmail, you don&rsquo;t move
anything but only ever add and remove labels.</p>

<p>Well, that was a big change.  Part of my Gmail organization, written
about recently, is how I keep some things in the Inbox and some bypass
it and are only in labels.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;d moved the Inbox-only items completely out of site, read or
unread.</p>

<p>Thinking quickly, too quickly, and acting too quickly, I realized I
could try the search &ldquo;label:done&rdquo; and find them all.  So I just took
that list, clicked the upper left box to check all on the screen, then
checked the little link that always pops up that says, &ldquo;Select all
messages that match this search&hellip;&rdquo; to select <em>all</em> of the Done
items.  Then I just added the Inbox label back to them.</p>

<p>Except now I move a lot of messages (again, hundreds) into the Inbox
that formerly my filter had kept from ever being in the Inbox.  My
levels of email importance, and the underlying sorting, are something
like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only in the Inbox</li>
<li>In the Inbox but with a label</li>
<li>Only in a label (not in the Inbox)</li>
<li>Only in a label and marked as read on delivery</li>
</ul>


<p>I should have included that list in my previous post.</p>

<p>I was finally able to mostly clean up this mess by selecting the
various labels, select all of the messages, which now had the Inbox
label, and click the Archive operation.  Archive is Gmail-speak for
special operation that just removes the Inbox label.</p>

<p>I should never have believed that the Inbox app would be harmless and
wouldn&rsquo;t have some effect on my regular Gmail account.  Gmail
desperately wants to manage my email for me (to the point of just
taking it over) and, as much as I really like Gmail and think it&rsquo;s by
far the best email solution, I have to beat it down hard with a big
stick every time it raises it&rsquo;s head and tries to attack my email with
unwanted help.  It&rsquo;s exhausting.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a metaphor for Google in general and will probably eventually
lead, in some large part, to their downfall.</p>

<p>I still like a lot about the Inbox app and it&rsquo;s interface and I&rsquo;ll
keep experimenting with a much less important account.</p>
