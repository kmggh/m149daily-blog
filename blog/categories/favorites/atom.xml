    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was recently wondering about the origin of Superman finding a phone
booth to change in.  I found one source on the origin and it was
surprising.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Why was I wondering about this in the first place?  It&rsquo;s because I was
thinking about the John Williams soundtrack from the 1978 movie.  I
recalled the scene where Clark Kent stops and glances at the little hood-like
phone booth and keeps going, looking for a place to change.  I
wondered where the changing in a phone booth meme came from since I
didn&rsquo;t recall Superman ever actually changing in a phone booth in any
of the comics or TV shows, etc.</p>

<p>A quick search online pulled up some interesting history including a
post by Steve Younis on supermanhoempage.com called &lsquo;Superman and the
Phone Booth."</p>

<blockquote><p>In the Golden Age of comic books Clark Kent didn&rsquo;t use a phone booth
to change into Superman. Actually right throughout every era of
Superman comics the phone booth change has rarely been seen.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first time Superman changes is (spoiler):</p>

<blockquote><p>The answer lies way back in 1941.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, Clark Kent first changed to Superman inside a phone
booth in &ldquo;The Mechanical Monsters&rdquo;, the second of 17 Superman
cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios for Paramount Pictures. It
was released to cinemas on November 28 in 1941.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was pretty much unaware of the Fleischer Studios Superman
animations.  They&rsquo;re very well done and influenced some of the more
recent TV animations in style.</p>

<p>I recommend finding &ldquo;The Mechanical Monsters&rdquo; on Youtube and watching it.</p>

    <link href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2015/08/02/blue-moon-definition-was-wrong/"/>

    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2015/08/02/blue-moon-definition-was-wrong</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a blog post I published in Mon 2010-11-22 on the previous
<a href="http://monolith149daily.blogspot.com/2010/11/blue-moon-definition-was-wrong.html">Monolith149 Daily
Site</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>What does this mean?  According to the &ldquo;new incorrect definition&rdquo; the
 blue moon was this past week 31 Jul (based on time zone actually) but
 the next &ldquo;old correct definition&rdquo; blue moon is not actually until 2016-05-21!</em></p>

<p>From a Space.com article by Joe Rao.</p>

<p>I was wrong.  My wife said last night that the moon was a blue moon.
I said, that&rsquo;s not possible because a blue moon is a second full moon
in the same month and that couldn&rsquo;t happen on 21 Nov.  It has to
happen at the very end of a month.  She pointed me at the above
article that explains it.</p>

<p>The short answer is that the two full moons in a month definition is
actually erroneous.</p>

<p>Rao notes that Lawrence J. Lafleur, in <em>Sky and Telescope</em> in 1943,
quotes a 1937 edition of the <em>Maine Farmer&rsquo;s Almanac</em>, stating that a
blue moon is the rare occurance of four full moons in a season instead
of three.  The blue moon is the third moon in that season.</p>

<p>The mistake was apparently made by James Hugh Pruett in a 1946 <em>Sky and
Telescope</em> where he misinterpreted Lafleur&rsquo;s explanation to mean a
second full moon in a single month.  (See the above article for
details).</p>

<p>The wrong explanation was propagated by Deborah Byrd in the radio
program &ldquo;Stardate&rdquo; in 1980 and then the wrong definition, quoting Rao,
&ldquo;went viral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It all makes me wonder when I first learned of the
two-full-moons-in-a-month definition.  I would have thought it was
long before 1980, but maybe it was after that date.</p>

<p>Well it sort of spoils the whole thing.  Now we&rsquo;ll have to talk about
old-correct-definition blue moons and new-incorrect-definition blue
moons and none of them will seem quite right any more.</p>

<p>This would all be a lot simpler if the moon would just actually turn
blue once in a while.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the Apple Support Communities, Linc Davis gives an excellent
answer to this question with a summary of the built-in security
features of OS X 10.10 and the additional precautions you should take.</p>

<blockquote><p>All versions of OS X since 10.6.7 have been able to detect known
Mac malware in downloaded files, and to block insecure web
plugins. This feature is transparent to the user. Internally Apple
calls it &ldquo;XProtect.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Starting with OS X 10.7.5, there has been a second layer of
built-in malware protection, designated &ldquo;Gatekeeper&rdquo; by Apple. By
default, applications and Installer packages downloaded from the
network will only run if they&rsquo;re digitally signed by a developer with
a certificate issued by Apple. Software certified in this way hasn&rsquo;t
necessarily been tested by Apple, but you can be reasonably sure that
it hasn&rsquo;t been modified by anyone other than the developer. His
identity is known to Apple, so he could be held legally responsible if
he distributed malware. That may not mean much if the developer lives
in a country with a weak legal system (see below.)</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Starting with OS X 10.8.3, a third layer of protection has been
added: a &ldquo;Malware Removal Tool&rdquo; (MRT). MRT runs automatically in the
background when you update the OS. It checks for, and removes, malware
that may have evaded the other protections via a Java exploit (see
below.) MRT also runs when you install or update the Apple-supplied
Java runtime (but not the Oracle runtime.) Like XProtect, MRT is
effective against known threats, but not against unknown ones. It
notifies you if it finds malware, but otherwise there&rsquo;s no user
interface to MRT.</p></blockquote>

<p>His answer is the third one down.</p>
