his disucussion on this week&rsquo;s Macbreak Weekly about blogging more
again and rediscovering MarsEdit  He refers to Jason Snell&rsquo;s Six
Colors, John Gruber&rsquo;s Daring Fireball and Jim Dalrymple&rsquo;s The Loop.
Even Leo said he was doing the same thing on his rejuvenated Leoville.</p>

<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll try kicking it up a notch, but maybe it&rsquo;s also time to
reflect on my setup with Markdown &ndash; Octopress &ndash; Github pages.</p>

<p>On 12 November 1971, exactly 43 years ago, Ray Bradbury spoke to an
audience at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the eve of Mariner 9
arriving at Mars.  On stage with him were Arthur C. Clarke, Carl
Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Walter Sullivan.  Bradbury read his poem, &ldquo;If
Only We Had Taller Been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today, on 12 November 2014, the Philae spacecraft &ldquo;docked&rdquo; with the
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/postimages/19-in-rack.png" title="" ></p>

<p><a href="/blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 19</a></p>

<p>Last night, while driving home, I stopped at an intersection where
work was being done on the traffic signals.  Looking at the open
control box I suddenly realized it was just a 19-inch rack inside the
silver box.  I think I even saw a network switch in there and a
surprising number of mounted devices.  That makes sense.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked around the standard 19-in racks in data centers for a long
time.  Even before that, when I was in school, it was common for a
physics lab to have a row of several 19-in racks.  They were usually
filled with instruments, controllers and maybe even an occasional
computer though microcomputers, small enough to fit in a rack, were
just beginning to appear on the scene.</p>

<p>Even large telescopes will have the standard racks mounted right on
the back of the telescope, like the 120-inch telescope here at the
Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/postimages/lick-120.jpg"></p>

<p>Where did they begin?  An on-line article &ldquo;Audio-Video Equipment
Racks&rdquo; credits Westinghouse.</p>

<blockquote><p>The origins of rack mounting dates to the days of industrialist George
Westinghouse way back in 1890. Westinghouse had first designed
19-inch shelving to house relay gear used in his railroad
industry. Eventually, early telephone companies also adopted this
19-inch width.</p></blockquote>

<p>For that reason they are sometimes called &ldquo;relay racks.&rdquo;  Wikipedia
says the relay rack name came from telephony and then appeared in
railroad signaling by 1911.</p>

<p>The Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) &ldquo;standardized them in its
310-D standard, first published in 1965.&rdquo;  That standard included the
1.75-in rack space height and the 19-in width (482.6 mm).</p>

<p>Wikipedia says,</p>

<blockquote><p>The 19-inch rack format with rack-units of 1.75 inches and holes
tapped for 12-24 screws with alternating spacings of 1.25 inches and
0.5 inch was an established standard by 1934. The EIA standard was
revised again in 1992 to comply with the 1988 public law 100-418,
setting the standard U as 44.5mm (15.9mm + 15.9mm + 12.7mm), making
each &ldquo;U&rdquo; officially 1.752 inches.</p></blockquote>

    <updated>2014-10-18T11:02:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/10/18/the-great-divide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/postimages/dark_site_map.png"></p>

<p><a href="/blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 8</a></p>

<p>Recently some article about an upcoming astronomical event, I don&rsquo;t
recall which one, referred to the web site
<a href="http://darksitefinder.com/">darksitefinder.com</a> and the typical light
pollution maps there.  The maps illustrate the light being emitted
from the earth, mostly man-made, light that is strongly reflected back
from the atmosphere that illuminates the night sky, obscuring the view
of distant, astronomical objects.  But I noticed something that hadn&rsquo;t
caught my eye before.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>There was a very distinct line separating densely populated areas from
the eastern continental United States from the west.  Sure, I know the
West is more sparsely populated, at least until you get to the West
Coast, but I didn&rsquo;t know the dividing line dropped off so sharply.
The illumination levels correlate pretty well with population so this
is population density we&rsquo;re seeing here in nearly all cases.</p>

<p>The drop off edge doesn&rsquo;t quite match anything I can think of.  It&rsquo;s
not aligned with the Mississippi or any river really, or other
geologic feature, or a shift in climate or moisture.  There are cases
of all of those near the line but they don&rsquo;t quite match.  Some don&rsquo;t
match by a long shot.  I wondered if it might be a major north-south
railway that the last wall of cities there lies along.  That might be
but then you&rsquo;d still have to ask why the railroad ran along that
line.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no historical boundary that corresponds either, that I&rsquo;ve been
able to find so far.</p>

<p>There must be something going on here.  Some global characteristic of
the continental U.S. that&rsquo;s larger than the growth and development of
little independent population centers.  A sharp line like that doesn&rsquo;t
imply independence.  (To be clear, I mean in the mathematical, process
sense).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/postimages/darksite_close.png"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also fascinated by the rectangle of cities that Atlanta lies
in. The shape of Atlanta&rsquo;s light blob reveals the three fingers of
growth to the north along the I-75, Georgia 400, and I-85 corridors.</p>

<p>The bottom side of the rectangle is Montgomery, Columbus, Macon, and
Augusta.  The top side is Huntsville, Chattanooga, and Asheville.
Huntsville, Birmingham, and Montgomery make the west edge.  Asheville,
Greenville-Spartanburg, and Augusta make the east edge.</p>

<p>Knoxville is almost part of the northern edge but is stretched up
north, because it follows I-75 I think.</p>

<p>The population flow from Atlanta to Greenville-Spartanburg, Charlotte,
Greensboro, and Raleigh-Durham is fairly prominent.</p>

<p>You can also see the dark skies (the blue area) of Eastern Georgia
between Atlanta and Augusta.  That&rsquo;s the location both of Georgia
State&rsquo;s Hard Labor Creek observatory and the Deer Lick Astronomy
Village.  In sad contrast, notice how little dark sky is left in the
North Georgia Mountains north of Atlanta.</p>
