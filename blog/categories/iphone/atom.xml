<p>Here&rsquo;s the most recent image of my iPhone home screen as it continues
to evolve.  I think the most recent, previous image was this one.</p>

<h2>Vs. the Old Screen</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/postimages/20141109_iPhone.jpg"></p>

<p>Instapaper is out.  I still use it on the desktop sometime but, since
I switched to Safari (yep), it has reading mode which is easy and
basically does the same thing.</p>

<p>I really like Read Quick and I&rsquo;m a fan of Clayton and Natalie Morris,
at least when they&rsquo;re on Twit.tv podcasts.  It&rsquo;s a neat idea and it
actually works, but I just wasn&rsquo;t using it.  When I&rsquo;m commuting
(driving) and at other times I&rsquo;m more often listening than reading.  I
just stopped using it very much.</p>

<p>The dreaded Facebook has arrived.  Yeah.  I finally decided to bite
the bullet and try using Facebook for news as well as family goings on
so I listened to Robert Scoble explain to Leo Laporte how to tune
Facebook&rsquo;s news feed, groups, etc.  I&rsquo;ve been using it since February.</p>

<p>I just removed Evernote and put Byword there a few minutes ago.  I&rsquo;m a
fan of Evernote but they seem to be struggling (as the press puts it)
and I decided it was a good time to move another one of my data sinks
to the text-Markdown world.  So now I write notes using Drafts, save
them to Dropbox (where they are titled and formatted) and access them
using various Markdown formatters.  The formatter that allows both
previewing the Markdown but also editing the notes within Dropbox is
Byword.  On the Mac desktop I use Marked for previewing and, of
course, just Emacs in a terminal window to edit.  This has been
working surprisingly well.  The only thing missing right now is that
Byword doesn&rsquo;t render included images.  There are some competing
standards between apps on how that&rsquo;s done, i.e., how images are
included.  There is Multi-markdown and I think it has a standard way,
but Byword doesn&rsquo;t seem to use it.  I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve done all of the
required homework on that one, though.</p>

<p>I still have my Evernote account and it&rsquo;s still on my phone, but just
not on the home screen.  I also exported my notes and wrote an XML
parser (well, I used the Python pre-existing XML library) to un-XML
them.</p>

<p>Drafts is a wonderful app I&rsquo;ve been using for a while.  As everyone
that talks about it says, it&rsquo;s just for entering text.  It opens super
fast and it&rsquo;s ready for you just to type.  I have it set up to take
notes and save them to Dropbox with the formatting described above.
It&rsquo;s where my notes went, even when I was using Evernote.  From other
apps' Share sheets, I can send things to Drafts so it basically
connects all of my apps together.</p>

<p>Finally, Safari.  Chrome just keeps bloating in various ways and I
heard that Safari handled battery life on the iPhone in a much better
way.  That makes sense.  It seems secure enough (but note the most
recent &ldquo;pwn&rdquo; (however you spell it) conference where Chrome withstood
and Safari fell two or three times.  I tried switching to Safari quite
a few months ago, both on the phone and desktop, and I&rsquo;ve been using
it ever since.  There are some Google apps that Chrome handles better,
mainly their finance stock charts, but usually Safari is fine.  Chrome
is still on my phone and I still use it at work.  I wouldn&rsquo;t argue
that Safari is better (except for the memory footprint, maybe faster
and with better battery management where I <em>would</em> argue it&rsquo;s better),
but it&rsquo;s seemed good enough so far.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are two key reasons that I&rsquo;m overjoyed to have made the switch
from Android to IOS and the iPhone.</p>

<p>One is the reliability of OS updates.  There&rsquo;s no worrying about
pure-Google vs. vendor-imposed-UI and junk apps. There&rsquo;s no waiting
for a vendor to either roll out an update or, more likely, just force
you to buy a new phone or wait for your cycle to end to get a new
phone.</p>

<p>The IOS updates are (so far) annual, universal and hassle
free.  And by hassel free I&rsquo;m referring to the above issues.  It&rsquo;s
granted there have been hiccups and bugs, but usually they are
resolved in a reasonable time.  I try to be cautious and wait for a
minor update or to before diving in.  Thus, I skipped 8.0 and waited
for 8.1.</p>

<p>The other joy is from the pictures the iPhones make.  There are
Android phones with better camera specs on paper, and yet, the photos
are often just not up to par.  My Galaxy Nexus made images that ranged
from okay to terrible.  When I go back and look at them now, they look
even worse than I realized.  I know other people disagree but I&rsquo;m
firmly in the camp: There&rsquo;s no contest here.</p>

<p>So, that makes two items removed from the list of things to have to
deal with.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 30</a></p>

<p>Today I upgraded to IOS 8.1 with no trouble and it&rsquo;s working well so
far.</p>

<p>I am one of those users who doesn&rsquo;t have the 5-GB or so of space on my
iPhone to do an over-the-air upgrade.  In spite of that, you can do an
upgrade without needing the space if you connect your iPhone to your
Mac (or Windows?) running iTunes and use iTunes to do the upgrade.  It
does the downloading and expansion of files on your desktop machine
then installs the upgrade over the USB cable.</p>

<p>The upgrade/install went without any trouble and it took almost
exactly 36 minutes it predicted.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve not used it too much.  So far, all the apps look and work the
same as in IOS 7.</p>

    <link href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/06/20/iphone-after-eight-months/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-20T06:17:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2014/06/20/iphone-after-eight-months</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/postimages/20140620_iphone.png"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s now been eight months since I switched to the iPhone in October
2012.  The honeymoon is over and I&rsquo;ve been chewing on the green grass
for a while.  I can say I&rsquo;m just as happy and pleased with the the 5C
as I was when it was new, maybe even more.</p>

<p>It does everything I need or want it to do.  I have a nice set of apps
I use daily, a simulation and a game here or there, and generally I
can find just about anything I need in an app and it all works fine.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still using the Gmail and the Google Maps apps for email, maps and
navigation.  Amazon cloud player was just updated and is still my
primary music player.  Netflix works fine but I typically use the
Youtube app for watching videos.</p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s iMessage works great for texting with images and video with
the rest of the family and we all have iPhones at this point.</p>

<p>The camera continues to make great pictures, as expected.</p>

<p>Here are some of the most recent apps of significance I&rsquo;ve added.
Loom was bought by Dropbox who introduced an app called Carousel, so
I&rsquo;m not using it to automatically upload and archive photos.  Carousel
is nice as an app but there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a correspondingly nice
web interface other then a plain Dropbox folder with a <em>lot</em> of image
files in it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of Facebook.  In fact I don&rsquo;t like it much at all.
However, I have to say that Paper is nicely done, beautiful in some
ways, but a little quirky sometimes.  I like it many times better than
the regular Facebook interface because it&rsquo;s fun to use, but I ignore
the news feed and those other screens.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve become interested in trains lately and Trainz Driver is a fun
simulator.</p>

<p>If you compare the current image of my home screen here to the image I
<a href="http:/m149daily-blog/blog/2013/10/07/transition-to-the-iphone/">posted back in October 2012</a>, you can see that it hasn&rsquo;t changed much.
That&rsquo;s screen one and I only use three screens of apps that are about
&frac12; to 2/3 full.</p>

    <link href="http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2013/10/07/transition-to-the-iphone/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-07T09:06:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://kmggh.github.io/m149daily-blog//blog/2013/10/07/transition-to-the-iphone</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/postimages/iphone_screen.png" title="" ></p>

<p>I can now summarize my previous post up in one sentence:  Android had
become tiring and I find the iPhone delightful.</p>

<p>The new iPhone 5C arrived on Wed 2013-10-02 and I found the transition
from the almost-two-year-old Android Galaxy Nexus 4.2.2 easy and
painless.  So far I&rsquo;m happy using a new device with a fresh new
interface and all that I consider essential.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>I ordered the iPhone 5C on-line at the Apple Store.  The process was
simple and integration with my Verizon account and changes were
straightforward.  There was no charge for shipping and the device
shipped by UPS and arrived in two days, i.e., I ordered it on Monday
and it arrived on Wednesday.  Somehow, Apple got the idea it should
have arrived on Tuesday and sent an apologetic email alert about a
shipping delay.</p>

<p>Transitioning the phone over to my Verizon account after turning it on
was equally simple and only involved entering my phone number and the
other typical identifying information Verizon wants.</p>

<p>Syncing my Gmail/Google contact list to the phone was a quick web
search and simply adding that account to the Settings for the phone.
I enabled contact syncing (but not email!) and much later, this
morning in fact, I turned on calendar syncing.  I didn&rsquo;t sync email
because I&rsquo;m using the Gmail app and not the iPhone email app.</p>

<h2>Apps</h2>

<p>For installing apps I logged into my existing Apple account with no
problem.  In the first evening I was able to easily install nearly
every app I consider essential, including all of the Google apps like
Gmail, Maps, Chrome and more.</p>

<p>I continued to pull down apps over the next few days as I thought of
them, needed them, or just had time to&mdash;the demand paging
approach.</p>

<p>Amazon Cloud player was also an easy install and works just as it does
on the Android.  It will stream from the cloud or download songs,
albums, or playlists to the phone to play them locally.</p>

<p>With a quick search of some on-line recommendations I settled on the
excellent program, Downcast, for downloading and playing podcasts.
Though I liked Doggcatcher on Android, I think Downcast is actually
much better.</p>

<p>I figured out how to rearrange the apps on the screens so that the
important apps were on the bottom bar (Amazon Cloud Player, Phone,
Messages, Chrome), how to put apps into folders, etc.  As expected,
there&rsquo;s still fiddling around left to do to get the arrangement of
apps and organization of the screens balanced so they work best for
me, but it&rsquo;s very workable right now.</p>

<h2>Anticipated Problems</h2>

<p>For the most part, things I worried about the most haven&rsquo;t been any
trouble at all.</p>

<p>Having no back button doesn&rsquo;t really cause a problem.  Apps usually
provide their own back button, or some equivalent, when you&rsquo;d need
one.  It&rsquo;s usually in the upper left corner.  And there&rsquo;s bailing out
with the home button but I rarely find myself using that as an
alternative to a back button.</p>

<p>Other changes in using a different interface just haven&rsquo;t been a
problem.  The new UI has been easy and fast to learn.  I like it a lot
and, since I didn&rsquo;t have IOS 6 as a reference, I don&rsquo;t have anything
to complain about regarding differences.</p>

<p>Surprisingly I don&rsquo;t miss the widgets at all.  There&rsquo;s a nice economy
of focus to only seeing information when you want to see it.  There&rsquo;s
not the distraction of some random Facebook update and, well, I guess
I just didn&rsquo;t really depend that much on the other widgets.  So, I
thought widgets were really neat, I still do, but I&rsquo;ve found they
aren&rsquo;t essential.  Perhaps that means they&rsquo;re really clutter, but I
like them enough I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest they be removed from Android.</p>

<p>One of the advantages of Android is the ability to customize almost
anything and everything.  It&rsquo;s probably my personal stage of phone
usage, but I don&rsquo;t want to do that kind of hacking, I just want
something that works.</p>

<h2>No perfect box</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the worst thing about the iPhone 5C: the box.  Most Apple
products come in packaging that&rsquo;s so nice you hate to throw it away.
The 5C came in a somewhat annoying, oversized, retro-like plastic
case.  And the worst sin of all, it was sealed with tape that left
behind a pet-roller-like sticky band which makes you want to throw
whole thing away as quickly as possible.  The opposite effect of the
typical packaging.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s not that important, really.  Just bothersome.</p>

<h2>Missing out on the Nexus 5</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mind.  If the leaked LG information is accurate, the Nexus 5
isn&rsquo;t attention-grabbing to me.  I have more to say in another post
about why that may be.  If I&rsquo;d waited and then sprung for the Moto X
or Nexus 5, I&rsquo;d have a phone nearly the same as what I had.  It might
perform better from some ratchet clicks of CPU specs, but I don&rsquo;t know
if I&rsquo;d notice.  Maybe.</p>

<h2>Reality check</h2>

<p>I know I&rsquo;m still grazing on the greener grass at the start of a
new-phone honeymoon.  The real test will be how its working after one,
six and 12 months.  But I have to say, being able to fall right in
with all that I consider essential right there and a nice solid
interface and hardware, I can&rsquo;t see the complaints yet.</p>
