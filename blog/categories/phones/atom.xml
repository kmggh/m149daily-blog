<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about getting an iPhone.  I know this is a shocking
thought.  I&rsquo;ve never had an iPhone before.  The only smart phones I&rsquo;ve
ever owned were the Android phones, starting with the G1.  I currently
have a Samsung Galaxy Nexus with (get out the phone, tap settings,
about phone, ah&hellip;) 4.2.2.  I&rsquo;d been planning to get a Samsung S4 or
S3.  I think the HTC One is currently the best Android phone hardware
out there.</p>

<h2>It has to be Google</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to one critical conclusion about Android phones.  I&rsquo;ll only
accept a &ldquo;pure Google&rdquo; phone.  Currently that would be the Moto X for
the newest.  I&rsquo;ve heard that Verizon&rsquo;s add-ons for the S4 are
unbearable.</p>

<p>My thinking had been that I&rsquo;d just download one of the ROMs and flash
an S4 into a more pure-Google experience, but that&rsquo;s looking like more
bother and annoyance than I&rsquo;m interested in.  In fact, the Android
experience seems to come with a growing amount of annoyance, in spite
of the great things about it.  The signal to noise ratio is getting
worse.  That&rsquo;s one reason I&rsquo;m thinking about changing.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s probably a new, pure Google phone soon to come, maybe under
the Nexus name.  It might be worth waiting for, but I&rsquo;m inclined not
to wait.</p>

<p>The S3 doesn&rsquo;t seem significantly different from my current,
two-year-old Galaxy Nexus.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that I&rsquo;m completely ensconced in the Google system of apps,
especially on my phone with Gmail Google Voice.  However, the web
experiences and apps on the iPhone seem acceptable.  The Google apps
on IOS may lag the Android world, but I&rsquo;m not looking for the latest
and greatest.  Lately I fear the continuous feature roll-outs from
Google.  I don&rsquo;t find that much delight in what&rsquo;s coming out
lately.  If IOS as a platform slows that down some, I may just count
that as a huge advantage.</p>

<h2>Iphone looks interesting and sufficient</h2>

<p>The iPhone seems both interesting and sufficient.  The new interface
looks pleasant.  It promises to bring some consistency and it has the
new, thin fonts (that Android recently brought) that I like.  Google
destroyed the nice clock the Android used to have with the stupid,
bold-face hour display.  If the IOS 7 UI is consistent and performs
well, that will meet my needs.</p>

<h2>Best Cameras</h2>

<p>The iPhones undoubtedly make the best pictures.  My family all have
iPhones now and their pictures are consistently better than those I
make with my phone.</p>

<h2>Reliable behaviour</h2>

<p>Android has been multitasking, in what I would consider a pure way,
since the beginning and I&rsquo;ve always appreciated that.  However, these
days, for whatever reason, I find myself constantly tapping things
where nothing happens.  Or the delay is so long I&rsquo;m not sure whether a
tap registered or not.  I&rsquo;ll take reliable behaviour over pure
multitasking and whatever else is going on there.</p>

<p>That said, I completely admit that this could be a false difference.
Finding out will be part of this &ldquo;experiment.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Apps and Widgets</h2>

<p>As far as I can tell, all of the apps that I consider essential to my
daily phone life are available.  I&rsquo;ll really miss the widgets,
particularly my analog clock and the weather widget.  I&rsquo;ll also miss
the little app that shows the time in various time zones with a little
globe, showing the day-night part of the earth, that I can spin around
with my finger.  I expect there&rsquo;s surely some similar IOS app there.
I&rsquo;ll find out.</p>

<p>I think the GPS navigation may not be as good, and that may be a huge
loss.  I&rsquo;ll have to see if that&rsquo;s the case and if I can live with
that.</p>

<h2>The smaller screen</h2>

<p>How will the smaller screen be?  This might be my biggest question.
Whenever I look at one of the family&rsquo;s phones, I never think, Wow,
that screen is really small.  I can barely look at it.  Generally I
don&rsquo;t even notice.  Apparent screen size has to do with viewing
distance.  If holding the screen closer enough to cancel any
difference isn&rsquo;t noticeable, it shouldn&rsquo;t matter.  This is something
I&rsquo;ll find out.  Update: Actually, I&rsquo;ve now held my Galaxy Nexus and an
iPhone 5c side by side and I barely had to move the screen a phone
thickness to match apparent sizes, actually solid angles.</p>

<h2>It&rsquo;s an experiment</h2>

<p>This will be an experiment.  I know the grass always looks greener on
the other side and I don&rsquo;t doubt that&rsquo;s true here.  I have complaints
and things annoy me.  My live snow fall wall paper is starting to
crash and it&rsquo;s starting to misbehave in other ways.  Still, I can
always return back to that phone, and a future pure Android phone, if
I can&rsquo;t stand the iPhone world.</p>

<p>If I do make this leap (I haven&rsquo;t committed yet), I&rsquo;ll write some
update on what I think about the progress.</p>

<h2>In summary</h2>

<p>My reasons for changing.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll only accept a pure Google phone for Android.</li>
<li>The current options really don&rsquo;t outshine my two-year-old 32-GB Galaxy Nexus.</li>
<li>Android signal-to-noise (delight vs. annoyance) is getting progressively worse.</li>
<li>IOS has Google apps.</li>
<li>IOS also has all of my other essential apps.</li>
<li>The iPhone has better cameras.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m convinced the UI behaviour is more reliable and stable.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some possible down sides.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll miss the widgets.</li>
<li>GPS navigation may not be good enough.</li>
<li>The smaller screen.</li>
<li>Something I haven&rsquo;t thought of.</li>
</ul>

<p>I heard Clayton Morris on this weekend&rsquo;s
<a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-tech/419">TWIT</a> about the poll
question &ldquo;What are your top five phone apps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was wondering about my answer.  Well, let me take out my phone and
have a look.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll assume the calling app (the little phone handset) doesn&rsquo;t count.
I&rsquo;m not sure about the Clock app counts either.  If it did, it would
be near the top, too.</p>

<p>Trying to sort some of the apps on my home screens by most used, I
come up with.</p>

<ol>
<li>Clock</li>
<li>Text msg</li>
<li>Chrome browser</li>
<li>Weather/News Gadget</li>
<li>Gmail</li>
<li>Dogg Catcher</li>
<li>RadarScope</li>
<li>Youtube</li>
<li>Google Maps</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Amazon MP3 Player</li>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>Gallery</li>
<li>Phone call</li>
</ol>


<p>If I remove what came on the pure Google Android OS (Currently 4.2.2),
and focus on the apps I downloaded from the app store, then that
leaves the following.</p>

<ol>
<li>RadarScope</li>
<li>Dogg Catcher</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Email Me</li>
<li>Amazon MP3 Player</li>
</ol>


<p>Runners up which <em>might</em> actually belong on this list, but I&rsquo;m not
really sure which I truly use the most over others.  I use them all
quite a bit.</p>

<ul>
<li>Instapaper</li>
<li>Kindle Reader</li>
<li>AK Notepad</li>
<li>RPN Calculator</li>
<li>Grocery IQ</li>
<li>Plants vs. Zombies</li>
<li>Search Light</li>
<li>Roku Remote</li>
<li>Poly Clock</li>
<li>UTC Time</li>
</ul>
