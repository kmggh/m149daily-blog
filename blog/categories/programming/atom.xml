    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An article titled &ldquo;Microservices – Please, don’t&rdquo; caught my eye, but I
think the author has it wrong.  It&rsquo;s true we&rsquo;ve been using the micro
service approach at work, building REST/JSON servers to provice APIs,
and I have been questioning whether this is the best approach.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>This author says that these are &ldquo;truths&rdquo; &ldquo;that people believe about
this approach&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<ol>
<li>It keeps the code cleaner</li>
<li>It’s easy to write things that only have one purpose</li>
<li>They’re faster than monoliths</li>
<li>It’s easy for engineers to not all work in the same codebase</li>
<li>It’s the simplest way to handle autoscaling, plus Docker is in here somewhere</li>
</ol>


<p>None of these have ever been my motivation for micro services.   I
never thought 1. was the case.  Clean code is the result of good style
and discipline, and readability in writing code.</p>

<p>Similarly, I&rsquo;m not sure what 2. has to do with micro services.  I can
write modules, objects, or functions that have only one purpose.</p>

<p>I never thought 3. was true but actually the opposite.  We&rsquo;re
replacing a local function call with a network transaction.</p>

<p>Similarly, 4. is also just not true.  Whether micro services are in
the picture or not, I take it as a given that code is properly divided
into reasonable components with well-defined interfaces and that are
loosely coupled.</p>

<p>I doubt that 5. is true, but it might be.  Scale has never been a
consideration in my thinking about micro services.</p>

<p>Here are some reasons that have been part of my thought process.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The API is language independent.  A program written in Java can
send an HTTP request as easily as a Python program, or a program in
any other language can.</p></li>
<li><p>The API is easy to test with something as simple as curl.</p></li>
<li><p>The API and HTTP request can cross network boundaries and into
different security domains, if permission is set up.</p></li>
<li><p>If a component needs to be recompiled, the micro services don&rsquo;t
need to be recompiled.</p></li>
<li><p>The micro service can be updated independently of the using code and
the clients all get the update immediately and with no changes.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>There are downsides I have worried about, though.  They include
standing up and maintaining so many services along with a lot of extra
network traffic.  It&rsquo;s also true that a well written library module is
easier to use and test in many ways.  The recompiling is not
necessarily a large cost.</p>

<p>On a very recent project at work, we went back to using libraries for
all of the application layers and components.  It&rsquo;s nice not to have
to stand up those services, but I&rsquo;ll find out if I miss some of those
advantages of the micro services.</p>
