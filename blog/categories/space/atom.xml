    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On an ISS Power supply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ISS is currently home to&hellip;four 14,000-pound payload-holders
called ExPRESS Logistics Carriers. Experiments from Earth like the
laser-communicator OPALS fly up to Station and Lego-attach to these
carriers, which provide them with a place to stay and, just as
importantly, the electrical power and data links they need to do their
jobs. But since 2013, scientists sending up payloads have had trouble
with the on-orbit utility grid.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>&ldquo;Right now, experiments need special power converters if they want to
hook up with the carriers. And that’s because NASA made a mistake:
Inside the carriers, some capacitors were installed incorrectly. &hellip;in
the part of the carriers that powers payloads, engineers installed
some capacitors backward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In designing the carrier, engineers had first planned to use
capacitors that they could hook in any which way. But then they had
changed the design, swapping in one-way capacitors. In between, no one
had updated the blueprints. And so the circuit makers had made the
circuits exactly as instructed, not paying attention to which way the
capacitors faced. All four on-orbit carriers and the in-space spare
turned out to have the same problem.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;A new environmental-monitoring satellite poised to launch into space
on Saturday (Nov. 19) will fly a lightning mapper higher than ever
before, allowing for better severe-storm monitoring across the United
States and in nearby regions, NASA officials said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>from Elizabeth Howell on Space.com.</p>

<!-- More -->


<blockquote><p>The GOES-R instrument, called the Geostationary Lightning Mapper, is
supposed to watch lightning around the Americas and nearby oceans to a
resolution of about 6.2 miles (10 kilometers).</p>

<p>An advanced baseline imager&hellip;will look at Earth in 16 different
spectral bands (11 more than the current GOES series) to provide
information on weather, climate and natural hazards.</p>

<p>The satellite will monitor solar flares— and the influence of the
sun&rsquo;s electromagnetic radiation in the Earth&rsquo;s upper atmosphere —
using the Extreme Ultraviolet and X-ray Irradiance Sensors. GOES-R
will also carry a telescope that can monitor the sun in extreme
ultraviolet wavelengths.</p>

<p>During solar events, GOES-R will predict the flux of charged particles
near Earth, using the Space Environment In-Situ Suite instrument and a
magnetometer.</p>

<p>GOES-R will be renamed GOES-16 when it goes to geostationary
orbit. The satellite will do a checkout and validation phase of about
one year, and then will begin operations.</p></blockquote>

<p>From the NOAA.gov page.</p>

<blockquote><p>GOES-R will scan the skies five times faster than today’s GOES
spacecraft, with four times greater image resolution and three times
the spectral channels. It will provide high-resolution, rapid-refresh
satellite imagery as often as every 30 seconds, allowing for a more
detailed look at a storm to determine whether it is growing or decaying.</p>

<p>There are four satellites in the GOES-R series: –R, –S, –T and –U,
which will extend NOAA’s geostationary coverage through 2036.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of talk about space exploration and development.
Here&rsquo;s a slightly more practical sounding vision from the United
Launch Alliance (ULA).</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with ULA, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;a
joint venture of Lockheed Martin Space Systems and Boeing Defense,
Space &amp; Security. ULA was formed in December 2006 by combining the
teams at these companies which provide spacecraft launch services to
the government of the United States. U.S. government launch customers
include both the Department of Defense and NASA, as well as other
organizations. With ULA, Lockheed and Boeing held a monopoly on
military launches for more than a decade, until the US Air Force
awarded a GPS satellite contract to SpaceX in 2016.&rdquo;  That&rsquo;s a quote
from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>With all of the talk lately about going to Mars, particularly after
Elon Musk&rsquo;s recent presentation of his Life to Mars vision, I&rsquo;ve been
giving some thought to what I really think about space travel in the
near future.  I&rsquo;ll write that up soon.  In the mean time, this
video seems to ring a bit more in tune with my off the cuff, poorly
informed, guesses.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Apollo 11 missing tapes refers to Apollo 11&rsquo;s slow-scan television
(SSTV) telecast recorded in its raw format on telemetry data tape
during the time of the first Moonlanding in 1969. The recordings were
discovered to be &ldquo;missing&rdquo; after a team of retired NASA employees and
contractors tried to locate the tapes in the early 2000s.</p></blockquote>

<!-- More -->


<blockquote><p>The data tapes were recorded as a backup in case the live television
broadcasts failed for any reason. In order to broadcast the SSTV
transmission on standard television, NASA ground receiving stations
performed real-time scan conversion to the NTSC television format. The
moonwalk&rsquo;s converted video signal was broadcast live around the world
on July 21, 1969 (UTC). At the time, the NTSC broadcast was recorded
on many videotapes and kinescope films: they were never missing.</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Although the researchers never found the telemetry tapes they were
looking for, they did discover the best visual quality NTSC videotapes
as well as super 8 movie film taken of a video monitor in Australia,
showing the SSTV transmission before it was converted. These visual
elements were processed in 2009, as part of a NASA approved
restoration project of the first Moonwalk. At a 2009 news conference
in Washington, D.C., the research team released its findings regarding
the tapes' disappearance. They also partially released newly enhanced
footage obtained during the search. Lowry Digital completed the full
Moonwalk restoration project in late 2009.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a time of Richard Branson and Virgin Galactic, along with
impressive amateur rocketeers and commercial space ventures, we might
have forgotten about Bob Truax, one of the first commercial, private
rocket jockeys.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia,</p>

<blockquote><p>Truax also designed the Skycycle X-2, which he unsuccessfully tested
on April 15, 1972 and June 24, 1973, and which Evel Knievel
unsuccessfully used at the Snake River Canyon in 1974.</p></blockquote>

<p>And also,</p>

<blockquote><p>The X-3 Volksrocket (other names: Arriba One, Skycycle X-3) was a
reusable space tourism rocket planned by Robert Truax after Evel
Knievel provided a $1,000 research grant for a pilot study. Truax
was looking for volunteers with enough money to help fund the effort
and who wished to fly aboard his rocket. He got thousands of
volunteers, but few of them had the financial resources.</p>

<p>The rocket used surplus components and was tested through 1991.</p></blockquote>

<p>There was actually a TV show based on Truax called <em>Salvage 1</em> and
starring Andy Griffith in 1979.</p>
