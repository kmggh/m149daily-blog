    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Apollo 11 missing tapes refers to Apollo 11&rsquo;s slow-scan television
(SSTV) telecast recorded in its raw format on telemetry data tape
during the time of the first Moonlanding in 1969. The recordings were
discovered to be &ldquo;missing&rdquo; after a team of retired NASA employees and
contractors tried to locate the tapes in the early 2000s.</p></blockquote>

<!-- More -->


<blockquote><p>The data tapes were recorded as a backup in case the live television
broadcasts failed for any reason. In order to broadcast the SSTV
transmission on standard television, NASA ground receiving stations
performed real-time scan conversion to the NTSC television format. The
moonwalk&rsquo;s converted video signal was broadcast live around the world
on July 21, 1969 (UTC). At the time, the NTSC broadcast was recorded
on many videotapes and kinescope films: they were never missing.</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Although the researchers never found the telemetry tapes they were
looking for, they did discover the best visual quality NTSC videotapes
as well as super 8 movie film taken of a video monitor in Australia,
showing the SSTV transmission before it was converted. These visual
elements were processed in 2009, as part of a NASA approved
restoration project of the first Moonwalk. At a 2009 news conference
in Washington, D.C., the research team released its findings regarding
the tapes' disappearance. They also partially released newly enhanced
footage obtained during the search. Lowry Digital completed the full
Moonwalk restoration project in late 2009.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a time of Richard Branson and Virgin Galactic, along with
impressive amateur rocketeers and commercial space ventures, we might
have forgotten about Bob Truax, one of the first commercial, private
rocket jockeys.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia,</p>

<blockquote><p>Truax also designed the Skycycle X-2, which he unsuccessfully tested
on April 15, 1972 and June 24, 1973, and which Evel Knievel
unsuccessfully used at the Snake River Canyon in 1974.</p></blockquote>

<p>And also,</p>

<blockquote><p>The X-3 Volksrocket (other names: Arriba One, Skycycle X-3) was a
reusable space tourism rocket planned by Robert Truax after Evel
Knievel provided a $1,000 research grant for a pilot study. Truax
was looking for volunteers with enough money to help fund the effort
and who wished to fly aboard his rocket. He got thousands of
volunteers, but few of them had the financial resources.</p>

<p>The rocket used surplus components and was tested through 1991.</p></blockquote>

<p>There was actually a TV show based on Truax called <em>Salvage 1</em> and
starring Andy Griffith in 1979.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26475-cargo-rocket-explosion-is-a-blow-for-commercial-space.html">New Scientist</a>.</p>

<p>The Orbital Sciences Antares rocket&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip;flying cargo to the International Space Station
exploded just 14 seconds after lift-off last night, creating a
spectacular fireball and shockwave as the fully fuelled rocket crashed
back down onto its launch pad.</p>

<p>No one was hurt when the uncrewed spacecraft was destroyed, but the
loss will dent attempts by the spacecraft&rsquo;s builder, Orbital Sciences
Corporation of Dulles, Virginia, to build confidence in its ability to
supply ISS cargo services to NASA.</p></blockquote>
