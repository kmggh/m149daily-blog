<blockquote><p>Whether and when NASA&rsquo;s Voyager 1 spacecraft, humankind&rsquo;s most distant
object, broke through to interstellar space, the space between stars,
has been a thorny issue. For the last year, claims have surfaced every
few months that Voyager 1 has &ldquo;left our solar system.&rdquo; Why has the
Voyager team held off from saying the craft reached interstellar space
until now?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Then on April 9, 2013, it happened: Voyager 1&rsquo;s plasma wave instrument
picked up local plasma oscillations. Scientists think they probably
stemmed from a burst of solar activity from a year before, a burst
that has become known as the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Solar Storms. The
oscillations increased in pitch through May 22 and indicated that
Voyager was moving into an increasingly dense region of plasma. This
plasma had the signatures of interstellar plasma, with a density more
than 40 times that observed by Voyager 2 in the heliosheath.</p>

<p>Gurnett and Kurth began going through the recent data and found a
fainter, lower-frequency set of oscillations from Oct. 23 to Nov. 27,
2012. When they extrapolated back, they deduced that Voyager had first
encountered this dense interstellar plasma in August 2012, consistent
with the sharp boundaries in the charged particle and magnetic field
data on August 25.</p>

<p>Stone called three meetings of the Voyager team. They had to decide
how to define the boundary between our solar bubble and interstellar
space and how to interpret all the data Voyager 1 had been sending
back. There was general agreement Voyager 1 was seeing interstellar
plasma, based on the results from Gurnett and Kurth, but the sun still
had influence. One persisting sign of solar influence, for example,
was the detection of outside particles hitting Voyager from some
directions more than others. In interstellar space, these particles
would be expected to hit Voyager uniformly from all directions.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the end, there was general agreement that Voyager 1 was indeed
outside in interstellar space,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;But that location comes
with some disclaimers &ndash; we&rsquo;re in a mixed, transitional region of
interstellar space. We don&rsquo;t know when we&rsquo;ll reach interstellar space
free from the influence of our solar bubble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, would the team say Voyager 1 has left the solar system? Not
exactly &ndash; and that&rsquo;s part of the confusion. Since the 1960s, most
scientists have defined our solar system as going out to the Oort
Cloud, where the comets that swing by our sun on long timescales
originate. That area is where the gravity of other stars begins to
dominate that of the sun. It will take about 300 years for Voyager 1
to reach the inner edge of the Oort Cloud and possibly about 30,000
years to fly beyond it. Informally, of course, &ldquo;solar system&rdquo;
typically means the planetary neighborhood around our sun. Because of
this ambiguity, the Voyager team has lately favored talking about
interstellar space, which is specifically the space between each
star&rsquo;s realm of plasma influence.</p></blockquote>

By Mike Wall, Senior Writer at Space.com</p>

<blockquote><p>A Minotaur V rocket will carry NASA&rsquo;s Lunar Atmosphere and Dust
Environment Explorer spacecraft (LADEE) on its maiden launch, which is
slated to take place Friday at 11:27 p.m. EDT (0327 GMT) from the
space agency&rsquo;s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.</p>

<p>The first three stages of the Minotaur V (and the Minotaur IV) are
solid rocket motors recycled from decommissioned Peacekeeper
intercontinental ballistic missiles. The fourth and fifth stages are
commercial Star motors, which are also flight-proven, [<em>Wallops
launch manager Doug</em>] Voss said.</p>

<p>The $280 million LADEE mission aims to study lunar dust and the moon&rsquo;s
wispy atmosphere from orbit using three science instruments.</p>

<p>[Space.com] Editor&rsquo;s note: Weather permitting, Friday&rsquo;s launch
 could be visible across wide regions of the U.S. East Coast.</p></blockquote>

<h2>What is LADEE</h2>

<p>From NASA:</p>

<blockquote><p>NASA&rsquo;s Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is a
robotic mission that will orbit the moon to gather detailed
information about the lunar atmosphere, conditions near the surface
and environmental influences on lunar dust. A thorough understanding
of these characteristics will address long-standing unknowns, and help
scientists understand other planetary bodies as well.</p>

<p>The LADEE spacecraft&rsquo;s modular common spacecraft bus, or body, is an
innovative way of transitioning away from custom designs and toward
multi-use designs and assembly-line production, which could
drastically reduce the cost of spacecraft development, just as the
Ford Model T did for automobiles. NASA&rsquo;s Ames Research Center
designed, developed, built and tested the spacecraft.</p></blockquote>
