to test the fundamental theories of black-hole physics by attempting
to take the first ever image of a black hole&rsquo;s event horizon (the
point at which theory predicts nothing can escape).&rdquo; from Space.com.</p>

<blockquote><p>By connecting a
global array of radio telescopes together to form the equivalent of a
giant Earth-sized telescope – using a technique known as Very Long
Baseline Interferometry and Earth-aperture synthesis – scientists will
peer into the heart of our Milky Way galaxy where a black hole that is
4m times more massive than our sun – Sagittarius A* – lurks.</p>

<p>Astronomers know there is a disk of dust and gas orbiting around the
black hole. The path the light from this material takes will be
distorted in the gravitational field of the black hole. Its brightness
and colour are also expected to be altered in predictable ways. The
tell-tale signature astronomers hope to see with the Event Horizon
Telescope is a bright crescent shape rather than a disk. And they may
even see the shadow of the black hole&rsquo;s event horizon against the
backdrop of this brightly shining swirling material.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brian Ventrudo writes about five classic telescopes in this article on
the <em>One-Minute Astronomer</em> blog.  Here&rsquo;s my own experience with these
instruments.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Unitron</h2>

<p>We had a 2.4 at the museum observatory and it was a
beautiful and delightful telescope.  I used it to observe, visually
via projection, the 1984 annular solar eclipse when I saw the Sun&rsquo;s
corona.</p>

<h2>Questar</h2>

<p>These portable little 3.5-inch Maksutovs were the beautiful jewels of
astronomy.  My planetarium and astronomical mentor, Mike Hood, has
collected Questars over the years.</p>

<h2>Celestron</h2>

<p>The leading Schmidt-Cassegrain brand ruled over our observatory.  We
had a 10-inch model identical to the one in Ventrudo&rsquo;s article.  It
was mounted on a permanent pier on the observatory floor.  There was
also the 14-in Celestron and two 8-inch models which I hauled around
to do observing programs.  I observed a large portion of the Messier
catalog on those 8-inches.</p>

<h2>RV-6 Dynascope</h2>

<p>The classic Criterion 6-in f/8 is a telescope I never owned or used
but I&rsquo;ve seen and looked through the RV-6.  I think there might have
been one added to the observatory collection after my time.  This
telescope and the corresponding Edmund Scientific 6-in f/8 Newtonian,
were the telescopes I dreamed most about in my early, teen astronomer
years.</p>

<h2>Coulter Dobs</h2>

<p>Dobsonian telescopes, which came to light around the turn of the
decade to 1980, changed amateur astronomy.  Large apertures became
affordable and usable.  I built my own 10-inch f/4.5 but bought the
optics from Coulter.</p>

<p>Some parting thoughts.</p>

<h2>Magnification</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a common misconception that telescopes are all about
magnification.  One sure sign of a questionable telescope is one that
puts its magnification up front.  Worse is one that advertises 200x,
300x, and more.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>It works like this.  The main mirror or lens, called the &ldquo;objective,&rdquo;
collects light, information, and produces a real image somewhere in
the back of the telescope.  It&rsquo;s usually inside the eyepiece holder.
It&rsquo;s called a real image because it acts like a little picture
floating there in space.  If you point a telescope at something and
look at the back of it, with no eyepiece, you can see the real image.</p>

<p>The quality of the image, including it&rsquo;s resolution, depends on the
amount of information collected by the objective, generally the larger
the aperture, the more detail is in the image.  The eyepiece is a
little magnifying lens you use to look at the image, just like you use
a magnifier to look at a small object like jewelry or a photograph.</p>

<p>If you imagine taking something with a picture like a newspaper,
magazine or a book (if you can even find one of those), and look at it
with say a 10x or 20x magnifier, you can probably see more details in
the picture.  You might be able to make out something that you missed
without the magnifier.</p>

<p>However, if you then find a 100x or 200x magnifier and look at the
picture, what do you think you&rsquo;ll see?  You&rsquo;ll probably see the dots
the picture is made of, or just a fuzzy blur but you won&rsquo;t see any
more details in the original picture.  There&rsquo;s not enough detail,
resolution, information in the picture for 200x to work.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the way a telescope real image works.  Even if the manufacturer
includes an eyepiece that gives 200x magnification, you&rsquo;ll just see an
unimpressive blur, if you could ever find the object at that
magnification.</p>

<p>Worse, you&rsquo;re also magnifying the speed at which an object in the
telescope appears to move (as the earth turns).  At 30x to 50x this
isn&rsquo;t that much a problem.  At 100x it&rsquo;s moving but you can keep up.
At higher magnifications, unless you have a mounting with a clock
drive, the object goes screaming by.</p>

<p>The basic rule of thumb is 20x to 30x per inch of aperture for normal
observing, and you might double it to get a closer look.  For a
2.4-inch telescope that means 40x to 80x.  Note in the previous post
that the Orion 2.4-inch has eyepieces for 28x and 70x.  That&rsquo;s
perfect!  200x or 400x for a 2.4 is absurd.</p>

<p>For the 4.5-inch telescope, 90x to 180x in theory are good.  It&rsquo;s
eyepieces at 36x and 91x are okay, but you could add an accessory to
take the 91x up to 150x to 200x but I&rsquo;d expect you to use those
magnifications rarely.</p>

<p>Back in the old observatory where we had a 14-inch Celestron
Schmidt-Cassegrain on a permanent pier mounting.  It was an f/11
telescope meaning the focal length was 154-inches (14 x 11) which
equals 3912 mm.  Our typical eyepieces when public observing were a
32-mm and 10-mm.  The 32-mm gave 122x and 24-mm at 162x.
(Magnification is just the telescope focal length divided by the
eyepiece focal length). We might use
a 10-mm or so for 391x, but usually not for the general public.  At
some point, the atmosphere itself limits the detail in the image,
regardless of how large the telescope is.  Astronomers call that
effect the &ldquo;seeing.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Clock Drives and Tracking</h2>

<p>As discussed above, we&rsquo;re standing on a moving platform, the earth.
For that reason, the whole sky is constantly turning as if we&rsquo;re on a
merry-go-round.  The sun, moon, stars, everything in the sky rises in
the east and sets in the west for this reason. Some telescopes have an
equatorial mounting and a clock drive or computer driven tracking
system to follow the stars across the sky.  If you&rsquo;re just doing
visual observing, and you have a good mounting, you can easily keep
the object you&rsquo;re observing in the field of view.  There&rsquo;s great joy
in visual observing this way.</p>

<p>If you do become interested in some types of visual imaging or more
serious observing of certain types, then you may want to look at a
telescope with a tracking system like this, but I wouldn&rsquo;t start with
one.</p>

<h2>Try Before You Buy</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great idea to see what it&rsquo;s like to use a telescope.  Visit
your local planetarium or observatory on an observing night or find a
local astronomy club.  Maybe go to a meeting or two, one where they
offer some presentation or have a speaker on some topic and then,
either at the same meeting or a separate one, where members bring
their telescopes which they&rsquo;ll happily show you along with views of a
variety of objects through them.</p>

<h2>Use the Internet</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve skipped explaining a lot of terms and concepts that surround
amateur astronomy and telescopes.  Excellent explanations are readily
available on the Internet.  Orion has nice tutorials and beginner
guides on their site.  Of course Wikipedia has articles on many topics
surrounding amateur telescopes.  And you&rsquo;ll find other sources.</p>

<p>You should also download the free software for your computer,
<em>Stellarium</em>.  This is a beautiful &ldquo;planetarium program&rdquo; that shows
you the current night sky or the sky from any location, time and date
on earth.  You can use it to learn constellations, what planets are
visible, and every other object in the sky an amateur would be
interested in.  You can also print star maps to take outside.</p>
