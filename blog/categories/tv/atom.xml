<p>Since it actually became a reality of sorts, I&rsquo;ve neither been
fanatical about nor enthusiastic for 3D TV.  I&rsquo;m not sure why.  After
all, it&rsquo;s been a wonderful orb set to rise on the future horizon for a
long time.  Now it&rsquo;s just one more thing that sits somewhere between
yawn-inducing boredom and outright annoyance.</p>

<p>The annoying part is demonstrated by 3D movies.<!-- more -->  I&rsquo;ve discovered in
more than one case that 3D can actually ruin a cinema outing.  Now I
avoid 3D movies.  In fact, I&rsquo;ve announced that I won&rsquo;t go to them any
more.</p>

<p><em>Avatar</em> was a beautiful movie.  I saw it in 3D IMAX and enjoyed every
bit of it.  But <em>TRON:Legacy</em> was a disaster in my 3D IMAX experience.
I liked the movie well enough, but there were weird reflections in the
3D glasses from the white light on black uniforms.  And sometimes I
couldn&rsquo;t tell which parts of the movie were the intentional 2D scenes
vs. the 3D scenes.  I&rsquo;d already given up on 3D movies once before but
I gave this one a shot based on a recommendation.  I don&rsquo;t intend to
make that mistake again soon.</p>

<p>What I do enjoy at the theatre is higher resolution. Those new digital
projection systems are wonderful!</p>

<p>I also like watching movies on HDTV and I expect that 4K TV will be
wondefully compelling.</p>

<p>It reminds me of an article I read some years ago about computer
screen resolution.  The technology was headed toward higher and higher
resolution displays but the author pointed out that color resolution,
lots more colors, was much more important to our eyes than spatial
resolution.  It&rsquo;s true. If you put a high-resolution screen beside a
lower-resolution but more-colors screen, you&rsquo;ll prefer the more
subtle, richer colors over the higher res.</p>

<p>Just like there&rsquo;s a place for written text, and there&rsquo;s certainly a
place for 2D images <em>that aren&rsquo;t moving</em>, there will always be a place
for 2D movies.</p>

<p>Yet, some day some inventor will get it just right and create a 3D
experience you have to go out and buy.  For now, I wonder if we&rsquo;ll
advance effect of immersion too far.  I don&rsquo;t want to walk in a room
at my house and have to grab a light sabre to fight for my life!
Sometimes I just want to sit down and watch TV.</p>

<p>I was sort of past &ldquo;kid&rdquo; when Sesame Street began, but some folks may
enjoy this nostalgia.</p>
