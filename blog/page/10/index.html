<p>Recommendations continued.</p>

<h2>The 2.4-inch Refractor</h2>

<p>I always recommend binoculars as a good way to start observing.
However, if you&rsquo;re a kid who wants a telescope, binoculars might be a
disappointment.  Many astronomers would scoff at the old 2.4-inch
standard but I think this is a fine telescope to start with.  It&rsquo;s the
lowest cost beginner scope and  you can use it to see the beginner
objects.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know when or how I first happened to hear the show <em>Car Talk</em>
but I quickly became a huge fan.  When I couldn&rsquo;t listen to the show
live, I got a subscription through Audible and would download MP3s of
the show and burn them onto CDs to listen to.</p>

<p>Click and Clack were hilarious, their personalities were infectious,
and their ability to diagnose car problems preceeded and exceeded
Dr. House&rsquo;s corresponding ability at playing the medical Sherlock
Holmes.</p>

<p>Probably like most listeners, it was a while before I learned that
they were actually both MIT graduates, Tom had a Ph.D., and that they
both played Bluegrass music.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been a listener for a few years but I&rsquo;ve always remained a
fan.</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite videos.  Martin Guitar presents Click and
Clack with a special Car Talk edition guitar.  Then they perform.</p>

<p>Recommendations continued.</p>

<h2>Binoculars</h2>

<p>The first recommendation is always binoculars.   They are two
telescopes instead of one.  They are the most portable telescopes you
can get and you get two, one for each eye.</p>

<p>The investment is around $100.  It&rsquo;s a good investment because,
regardless of how serious you become as an astronomer, you always have
a need for binoculars.  There are some objects that don&rsquo;t look as good
in a telescope.  A total lunar eclipse is an example.  When I was a
serious deep sky observer, I often found objects or at least the stars
surrounding their location using binoculars.</p>

<p>Recommendations.</p>

<h2>Orion</h2>

<p>Since the planetarium days, I&rsquo;ve favored Orion Telescopes as an
excellent and reliable source of reasonably priced and good quality
telescopes.  Their telescopes are well-made, of outstanding quality,
and not the absurdly overpriced telescopes you find at your nearest
big store.</p>

<p>What we used to call those &ldquo;department store&rdquo; telescopes, which
typically were of poor quality and vastly overpriced.  The classic
starter telescope is a 2.4-inch (60-mm) refractor on an altazimuth
mount.  I&rsquo;ve seen the &ldquo;department store&rdquo; versions of these for $250,
even $400.  The are often advertised as 400X or 300X magnification
(which is absurd and meaningless).  That same telescope, of higher
quality, outstanding and appropriate accessories at Orion is $100.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to cover all of the different types of telescopes but
just refer you to the web for that.  You should read about refractors
and reflectors.  Equatorial mounts and altazimuth.  Dobsonian,
Newtonian and Schmidt-Cassegrain, Maksutov and catadioptric telescopes
in general.  It sounds like a lot, but the basic ideas are not
complicated.</p>

<h2>*Posting Day</h2>

<p><em>I wrote this post while away from home on Sat 2014-11-01 and didn&rsquo;t
actually post it on day 23 but after midnight at 1:14 on day 24.  I
don&rsquo;t actually have a way to post entries when away from home so I can
only write them and then post them later.  So, in fact, I didn&rsquo;t
actually do any of the work on this post on day 23.</em></p>

<p>Back in the planetarium days I was frequently asked about buying a
telescope, especially around Christmas.  Over the decades since then
people still ask me from time to time and still ask more often around
Christmas.  I had a pretty well-formulated answer eventually and I&rsquo;ve
written it up a number of times.  (I&rsquo;m not sure if I know where any of
those old write ups are).</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start with the basics, what&rsquo;s important when it comes to
telescopes:   aperture, mounting and portability.</p>

<p>For several months now Steve Gibson of GRC.com and Security Now has
been working on a new authentication protocol he named SQRL, the
Secure Quick Reliable Login.  On his web site he describes what
happens when you log into a site, say Amazon, using SQRL (assuming
Amazon adopted it).</p>

<p>The website displays a QR code, described as a &ldquo;SQRL code,&rdquo; beside the
usual userid and password login prompt.</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>The user can tap or click directly on the SQRL code to login, or
launch their smartphone&rsquo;s SQRL app, and scan the QR code.</li>
<li>For verification, SQRL displays the domain name contained in the
SQRL code.</li>
<li>After verifying the domain, the user permits the SQRL app to
authenticate their identity.</li>
<li>Leaving the login information blank, the user clicks the “Log in”
button&hellip; and is logged in.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The approach is highly secure, difficult to attack, easy to implement,
and easy to use.  He describes details at his site.</p>

<p>This is an elegant solution to the problems that come from dealing
with passwords and I hope it continues to climb since it&rsquo;s taken off!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2014/10/are-quasars-dying-at-the-farthest-reaches-of-the-universe.html">The Daily Galaxy</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have been able to confirm that, indeed, apart from the highly
energetic and rapidly evolving quasars, there is another population
that evolves slowly. This population of quasars appears to follow the
quasar main sequence discovered by Sulentic and colleagues in
2000. There does not even seem to be a strong relation between this
type of quasars, which we see in our environment and those &lsquo;monsters&rsquo;
that started to glow more than ten billion years ago&rdquo;, says Ascensión
del Olmo another IAA-CSIC researcher taking part in the study.</p>

<p>They have, nonetheless, found differences in this population of quiet
quasars. &ldquo;The local quasars present a higher proportion of heavy
elements such as aluminium, iron or magnesium, than the distant
relatives, which most likely reflects enrichment by the birth and
death of successive generations of stars,&rdquo; says Jack W. Sulentic
(IAA-CSIC). &ldquo;This result is an excellent example of the new
perspectives on the universe which the new 10 meter-class of
telescopes such as GTC are yielding,&rdquo; the researcher concludes.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="/m149daily-blog/blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 19</a></p>

<p>Last night, while driving home, I stopped at an intersection where
work was being done on the traffic signals.  Looking at the open
control box I suddenly realized it was just a 19-inch rack inside the
silver box.  I think I even saw a network switch in there and a
surprising number of mounted devices.  That makes sense.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked around the standard 19-in racks in data centers for a long
time.  Even before that, when I was in school, it was common for a
physics lab to have a row of several 19-in racks.  They were usually
filled with instruments, controllers and maybe even an occasional
computer though microcomputers, small enough to fit in a rack, were
just beginning to appear on the scene.</p>

<p>Even large telescopes will have the standard racks mounted right on
the back of the telescope, like the 120-inch telescope here at the
Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/m149daily-blog/postimages/lick-120.jpg"></p>

<p>Where did they begin?  An on-line article &ldquo;Audio-Video Equipment
Racks&rdquo; credits Westinghouse.</p>

<blockquote><p>The origins of rack mounting dates to the days of industrialist George
Westinghouse way back in 1890. Westinghouse had first designed
19-inch shelving to house relay gear used in his railroad
industry. Eventually, early telephone companies also adopted this
19-inch width.</p></blockquote>

<p>For that reason they are sometimes called &ldquo;relay racks.&rdquo;  Wikipedia
says the relay rack name came from telephony and then appeared in
railroad signaling by 1911.</p>

<p>The Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) &ldquo;standardized them in its
310-D standard, first published in 1965.&rdquo;  That standard included the
1.75-in rack space height and the 19-in width (482.6 mm).</p>

<p>Wikipedia says,</p>

<blockquote><p>The 19-inch rack format with rack-units of 1.75 inches and holes
tapped for 12-24 screws with alternating spacings of 1.25 inches and
0.5 inch was an established standard by 1934. The EIA standard was
revised again in 1992 to comply with the 1988 public law 100-418,
setting the standard U as 44.5mm (15.9mm + 15.9mm + 12.7mm), making
each &ldquo;U&rdquo; officially 1.752 inches.</p></blockquote>

<p>I just set up Inbox on a very old, in fact my oldest, earliest, Gmail
account.  Come to think of it, I guess that&rsquo;s appropriate in a way.
Here, briefly, are my very first impressions.</p>

<h2>Short Version</h2>

<p>Inbox is like the dead mouse your cat brings to you.  Thanks but
that&rsquo;s not exactly what I wanted and it&rsquo;s not quite useful to me,
though I appreciate the work you&rsquo;ve done.  I may even be impressed by
it.  It&rsquo;s true I could use something to eat right now, maybe even
something about that size, but that isn&rsquo;t it.</p>
