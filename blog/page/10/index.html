platinum and iridium cylinder that for 126 years has defined the

they at last have the data needed to replace the cylinder with a
definition based on mathematical constants.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>One method, pioneered by an international team known as the Avogadro
Project, involves counting the atoms in two silicon-28 spheres that
each weigh the same as the reference kilogram. This allows them to
calculate a value for Avogadro’s constant, which the researchers
convert into a value for Planck’s constant. Another method uses a
device called a watt balance to produce a value for Planck’s constant
by weighing a test mass calibrated according to the reference kilogram
against an eletromagnetic force.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting article about Uber&rsquo;s use of service oriented
architecture (SOA).</p>

<blockquote><p>As core domain models grew and new features were introduced, our
components became tightly coupled, and enforcing encapsulation made
separation of concerns difficult. Continuous integration turned into a
liability because deploying the codebase meant deploying everything at
once. Our engineering team experienced rapid growth and scaling, which
not only meant handling more requests but also handling a significant
increase in developer activity. Adding new features, fixing bugs, and
resolving technical debt all in a single repo became extremely
difficult. Tribal knowledge was required before attempting to make a
single change.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a posted discussion Jeff Atwood claims that, &ldquo;For several years now
we&rsquo;ve tracked the fact that, over time from 2012 onward, Android
JavaScript performance has become wildly divergent from iOS JavaScript
performance. And not in a good way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He says:</p>

<blockquote><p>This is the benchmark most representative of Discourse performance,
and the absolute best known Android score for this benchmark is right
at ~400ms on a Samsung Galaxy S6. That doesn&rsquo;t seem too bad until you
compare..</p>

<p>iPhone 5 → 340ms<br />
iPhone 5s → 175ms<br />
iPhone 6 → 140ms<br />
iPad Air 2 → 120ms<br />
iPhone 6s → 60-70ms</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the fastest known Android device available today &mdash; and
there are millions of Android devices much slower than that out there
&mdash; performs 5× slower than a new iPhone 6s, and a little worse than a
2012 era iPhone 5 in Ember. How depressing.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For some reason, the chat paradigm has become overly popular.  Internet
relay chat (IRC) was interesting in the mid-90s as a way to
communicate in an informal, unstructured sense.  However, I can&rsquo;t
believe it&rsquo;s still so popular.  Then we have Hipchat, Slack and
others.  What&rsquo;s the deal?</p>

<p>What is the utility of an endless scroll of mixed up and confused,
uncollated, blended conversations with no good way to determine their
topics or context?</p>

<p>Maybe it is the valid rebellion against email.  I thought for a while
that email had reached the end of its usefulness.  However, in my own
personal quest for a substitute, I&rsquo;ve reluctantly come to the
conclusion that email is the only workable, reliable solution.</p>

<p>Granted phone text messages are how I normally communicate with my
family.  Beyond my immediate family, family and friends are all on
Facebook.  One or two people still seem to use Google+ and, of course,
most Google employees.</p>

<p>Email has subjects, labels and excellent search.  It accommodates
messages of any length, including super short.</p>

<p>I do like the idea of minimal email and Google Inbox makes a valiant
attempt but I expect it to be squashed any minute as is the end of all
Google services, useful or not.  Ultimately, the native, plain
old Gmail is actually quite minimal when you really look at it.  Each
message in a conversation has the names of the people, a picture of
the sender and the message.  It looks like chat.</p>

<p>One personal change I&rsquo;ve made quietly over the past few months is to
drop all signatures including just signing my name on email messages.
The truth is we still have a compulsion to write an email message like
a letter or office memo, and not like a tweet or chat snippet.  I&rsquo;ll
still write in complete, hopefully correct, sentences with correct
spelling.  When corresponding with someone I don&rsquo;t often send email
to, then I&rsquo;m less familiar and will include my first name or full name
and maybe even a signature if it&rsquo;s a business message.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is a blog post I published in Mon 2010-11-22 on the previous
<a href="http://monolith149daily.blogspot.com/2010/11/blue-moon-definition-was-wrong.html">Monolith149 Daily
Site</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>What does this mean?  According to the &ldquo;new incorrect definition&rdquo; the
 blue moon was this past week 31 Jul (based on time zone actually) but
 the next &ldquo;old correct definition&rdquo; blue moon is not actually until 2016-05-21!</em></p>

<p>From a Space.com article by Joe Rao.</p>

<p>I was wrong.  My wife said last night that the moon was a blue moon.
I said, that&rsquo;s not possible because a blue moon is a second full moon
in the same month and that couldn&rsquo;t happen on 21 Nov.  It has to
happen at the very end of a month.  She pointed me at the above
article that explains it.</p>

<p>The short answer is that the two full moons in a month definition is
actually erroneous.</p>

<p>Rao notes that Lawrence J. Lafleur, in <em>Sky and Telescope</em> in 1943,
quotes a 1937 edition of the <em>Maine Farmer&rsquo;s Almanac</em>, stating that a
blue moon is the rare occurance of four full moons in a season instead
of three.  The blue moon is the third moon in that season.</p>

<p>The mistake was apparently made by James Hugh Pruett in a 1946 <em>Sky and
Telescope</em> where he misinterpreted Lafleur&rsquo;s explanation to mean a
second full moon in a single month.  (See the above article for
details).</p>

<p>The wrong explanation was propagated by Deborah Byrd in the radio
program &ldquo;Stardate&rdquo; in 1980 and then the wrong definition, quoting Rao,
&ldquo;went viral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It all makes me wonder when I first learned of the
two-full-moons-in-a-month definition.  I would have thought it was
long before 1980, but maybe it was after that date.</p>

<p>Well it sort of spoils the whole thing.  Now we&rsquo;ll have to talk about
old-correct-definition blue moons and new-incorrect-definition blue
moons and none of them will seem quite right any more.</p>

<p>This would all be a lot simpler if the moon would just actually turn
blue once in a while.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Haas devoted his entire life to the study of the Moon and planets.</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>At a time when professional astronomers held little regard for amateur
observers beyond their meteor and variable-star reports, Haas changed
the paradigm. First, he published (in 1938, at age 21) his in-depth
observations of brightness changes around major lunar craters. Then,
four years later, he followed with a four-part, 76-page opus titled
&ldquo;Does Anything Ever Happen on the Moon?&rdquo; that appeared in the Journal
of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. These became the opening
salvo in a lifelong quest &ldquo;to arouse interest in a neglected branch of
astronomy.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>On March 1, 1947, while still at UNM, he dispatched a self-produced
6-page newsletter titled The Strolling Astronomer. Haas already
envisioned this simple missive becoming something bigger: it was
subtitled &ldquo;Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers&rdquo; and branded
with &ldquo;Volume 1, Number 1.&rdquo; By the second issue, a month later, the
budding ALPO had grown to 41 members. Within six years, the
association boasted 350 members from all around the world.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An article from Tech Crunch by Jon Evans on how bad current interview
practices are.  It&rsquo;s quite interesting and echoes a lot of my
coworkers&#8217; and my recent sentiments.</p>

<blockquote><p>Traditional technical interviews are terrible for everyone. They’re a
bad way for companies to evaluate candidates. They’re a bad way for
candidates to evaluate companies. They waste time and generate stress
on both sides. Almost everyone, if pressed, will admit this. And yet
they persist.</p></blockquote>

<p>His solution:  Every candidate should bring with them a personal side
project the have done (this assumes a programming project) that they
can present in detail including code walk throughs and answering
questions.  The interviewer should be prepared to look at this in lieu
of asking white board questions and such.  This is a fascinating idea,
an excellent use of everyone&rsquo;s time, and could really change the whole
process for the better.  I don&rsquo;t hold a lot of hope this idea would
ever be widely adopted, if even adopted at all, but maybe.</p>
