  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a time of Richard Branson and Virgin Galactic, along with
impressive amateur rocketeers and commercial space ventures, we might
have forgotten about Bob Truax, one of the first commercial, private
rocket jockeys.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia,</p>

<blockquote><p>Truax also designed the Skycycle X-2, which he unsuccessfully tested
on April 15, 1972 and June 24, 1973, and which Evel Knievel
unsuccessfully used at the Snake River Canyon in 1974.</p></blockquote>

<p>And also,</p>

<blockquote><p>The X-3 Volksrocket (other names: Arriba One, Skycycle X-3) was a
reusable space tourism rocket planned by Robert Truax after Evel
Knievel provided a $1,000 research grant for a pilot study. Truax
was looking for volunteers with enough money to help fund the effort
and who wished to fly aboard his rocket. He got thousands of
volunteers, but few of them had the financial resources.</p>

<p>The rocket used surplus components and was tested through 1991.</p></blockquote>

<p>There was actually a TV show based on Truax called <em>Salvage 1</em> and
starring Andy Griffith in 1979.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do worm holes even exist?  At Smithsonian.com, Victoria Jaggard
writes the article &ldquo;Would Astronauts Survive an Interstellar Trip Through a
Wormhole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Given the state of current physics the answer is, No.  The idea of
worm holes has come and gone in the science world, though it never
quite leaves.  The Kerr metric solution to Einstein&rsquo;s general
relativity equations applies to &ldquo;rotating&rdquo; black holes and adds new
twists, however there&rsquo;s still not really a way for humans to get
through.</p>

<p>Just like crossing an event horizon is beyond the edge of our
universe, these ideas are beyond the edge of our science.  Of course
we don&rsquo;t know everything and I have no doubt there are amazing things
still to be discovered.  I&rsquo;d never say it can&rsquo;t happen, just that we
don&rsquo;t have a good mechanism in our current astrophysics toolbox unless
we toss in a little magic.  Just like it is with faster-than-light
travel.</p>

<blockquote><p>Despite his ties to the film, [cosmologist Kip] Thorne is also
pessimistic that a traversable wormhole is even possible, much less
survivable. &ldquo;If they can exist, I doubt very much that they can form
naturally in the astrophysical universe,&rdquo; he writes in the book. But
Thorne appreciates that Christopher and Jonah Nolan, who wrote
Interstellar, were so keen to tell a story that is grounded in
science.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s more to come on this topic and other folks have weighed in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>A team of astronomers using the Subaru Telescope&rsquo;s Suprime-Cam to
perform the Subaru Ultra-Deep Survey for Lyman-alpha Emitters have
looked back more than [<em>z=7</em>] to find 7 early galaxies that
appeared quite suddenly within 700 million years of the Big Bang. The
team, led by graduate student Akira Konno and Dr. Masami Ouchi
(Associate Professor at the University of Tokyo&rsquo;s ICRR) was looking
for a specific kind of galaxy called a Lyman-alpha emitter (LAE), to
understand the role such galaxies may have played in an event called
&ldquo;cosmic reionization&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<p>The team looked at distant galaxies that primarily emit Lyman-alpha
radiation, &ldquo;Lyman-alpha emitters&rdquo; or LAE, and saw fewer than expected,
further back in time.  There&rsquo;s an apparent sudden cutoff at that
redshift.  The redshift corresponds to a distance and time in history
that&rsquo;s model dependent.  The standard big bang model would put this at
about 13.1 billion years and only 700 million years after the big bang
itself.  The cosmological-history implication is that these galaxies
&ldquo;suddenly&rdquo; appear.</p>

<p>One thing is pretty certain.  A cosmological redshift of seven
indicates the universe was about 1/8 it&rsquo;s current size at the time the
light they observed was emitted.  That&rsquo;s 1 / (<em>z</em> + 1).</p>

<blockquote><p>According to the team&rsquo;s analysis, one reason that LAEs appeared very
quickly is cosmic reionization. LAEs in the epoch of cosmic
reionization became darker than the actual luminosity due to the
presence of the neutral hydrogen fog. In the team&rsquo;s analysis of their
observations, they suggest the possibility that the neutral fog
filling the universe was cleared about 13.0 billion years ago and LAEs
suddenly appeared in sight for the first time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, there are other possibilities to explain why LAEs appeared
suddenly,&rdquo; said Dr. Ouchi, who is the principal investigator of this
program. &ldquo;One is that clumps of neutral hydrogen around LAEs
disappeared. Another is that LAEs became intrinsically bright. The
reason of the intrinsic brightening is that the Lyman-alpha emission
is not efficiently produced by the ionized clouds in a LAE due to the
significant escape of ionizing photons from the galaxy. In either
case, our discovery is an important key to understanding cosmic
reionization and the properties of the LAEs in early universe.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&rsquo;s a question that have been worrying many of us for quite a few
years now.  How will today&rsquo;s kids learn to program?</p>

<p>In the late 70s and 80s many kids were blessed with a microcomputer in
their home that ran BASIC.  Most folks don&rsquo;t even know or remember
that the first IBM PC booted straight up into BASIC, just like a
Commodore 64. That&rsquo;s where they learned to program.  Those BASIC
computers launched a whole generation of computer programmers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I first began the 30-day blogging challenge the indie web
movement was on my list of topics to discus.  My thinking on
it, and related topics, is still unsettled.  I&rsquo;ve read some and, well,
read some more.  Kevin Marks frequently appears on the Twit network
and particularly on <em>This Week in Google</em>, and has talked about the
indie web on many occasions.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a brief and early poll on where I am so far.  I like the basic
principle of owning all of your content.  That&rsquo;s the foundation of
this very site, this blog.  I don&rsquo;t like strongly coupling my various
identities across sites, not that strongly.  I prefer that they be
weakly coupled, if at all.  I&rsquo;m not that interested in discussions,
engagement and feedback.  At least not in the usual way they occur on
the web.</p>

<p>Microformats comprise a clever and intriguing idea.  I think there&rsquo;s value
in this evolved approach to (this part of) the so-called semantic
web.</p>

<p>The microformats movement has eschewed email and gone to using IRC
(Internet Relay Chat) and a wiki for their communication.  This hits
at the communication problems that I spend a lot of my
internet-thinking time on.  Email seems terribly inadequate in many
ways and yet insists being the best fit for many needs, particularly
when Gmail is used.  I agree with not using email for long messages or
long documents&mdash;I&rsquo;ve adopted a similar approach to communication.
(For long documents and messages I email a Google document instead of
a long email message).</p>

<p>I loathe using IRC.  That in itself is worth at least one long blog
post.  We use it at work since I&rsquo;ve been unable to stave off the push
by the millennials (plus or minus) there to use IRC.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a very nice &ldquo;indie web in a box,&rdquo; With Known, which you can
even get a hosted account with.  At first, that seems anti-indie-web,
but it&rsquo;s all very well done.  The source is open and you can start on
their servers then move onto your own when you wish, similar to using
Wordpress.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s a quick update.  There should be more to come.</p>

<p>On 12 November 1971, exactly 43 years ago, Ray Bradbury spoke to an
audience at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the eve of Mariner 9
arriving at Mars.  On stage with him were Arthur C. Clarke, Carl
Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Walter Sullivan.  Bradbury read his poem, &ldquo;If
Only We Had Taller Been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today, on 12 November 2014, the Philae spacecraft &ldquo;docked&rdquo; with the
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.</p>
