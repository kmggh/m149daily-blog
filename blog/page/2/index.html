<blockquote><p>At a time when professional astronomers held little regard for amateur
observers beyond their meteor and variable-star reports, Haas changed
the paradigm. First, he published (in 1938, at age 21) his in-depth
observations of brightness changes around major lunar craters. Then,
four years later, he followed with a four-part, 76-page opus titled
&ldquo;Does Anything Ever Happen on the Moon?&rdquo; that appeared in the Journal
of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. These became the opening
salvo in a lifelong quest &ldquo;to arouse interest in a neglected branch of
astronomy.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>On March 1, 1947, while still at UNM, he dispatched a self-produced
6-page newsletter titled The Strolling Astronomer. Haas already
envisioned this simple missive becoming something bigger: it was
subtitled &ldquo;Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers&rdquo; and branded
with &ldquo;Volume 1, Number 1.&rdquo; By the second issue, a month later, the
budding ALPO had grown to 41 members. Within six years, the
association boasted 350 members from all around the world.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An article from Tech Crunch by Jon Evans on how bad current interview
practices are.  It&rsquo;s quite interesting and echoes a lot of my
coworkers&#8217; and my recent sentiments.</p>

<blockquote><p>Traditional technical interviews are terrible for everyone. They’re a
bad way for companies to evaluate candidates. They’re a bad way for
candidates to evaluate companies. They waste time and generate stress
on both sides. Almost everyone, if pressed, will admit this. And yet
they persist.</p></blockquote>

<p>His solution:  Every candidate should bring with them a personal side
project the have done (this assumes a programming project) that they
can present in detail including code walk throughs and answering
questions.  The interviewer should be prepared to look at this in lieu
of asking white board questions and such.  This is a fascinating idea,
an excellent use of everyone&rsquo;s time, and could really change the whole
process for the better.  I don&rsquo;t hold a lot of hope this idea would
ever be widely adopted, if even adopted at all, but maybe.</p>

<time datetime="2015-03-23T08:13:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mon 23 Mar 2015  08:13 EDT</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, that was a mistake.  To a large degree I really like Gmail&rsquo;s new
Inbox IOS app, and the desktop version doesn&rsquo;t look bad either.  I&rsquo;ve
used it on a rarely-used account and recently added in anther,
more-often-used account so I could try out more interaction.  I heard
someone on a podcast say, It doesn&rsquo;t really affect your regular Gmail
interface interactions so you can use both at the same time.  That
seemed to be the case to me, so I thought, okay, I&rsquo;ll just fire it up
on my main Gmail account.</p>

<p>That was a mistake.</p>

<p>So it does have an effect in a particular way.  I should have seen
it.  The Gmail model is to treat messages like to do items and mark
them as &ldquo;Done&rdquo; when you are finished with them, instead of marking
them as &ldquo;Read.&rdquo;  Marking as &ldquo;Read&rdquo; is still there but it&rsquo;s
independent.  Of course, &ldquo;Done&rdquo; is yet another label though it doesn&rsquo;t
show up in the list of labels so maybe it&rsquo;s more a kind of state.
However, you can search in the regular Gmail for &ldquo;label:done&rdquo; and it
will find your done messages.  (That&rsquo;s giving away the ending).</p>

<p>With the Inbox app, you can go through and use the little &ldquo;sweep&rdquo;
icons to sweep away large collections of messages as &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; all in
one, uh, swoop.  Fortunately, it didn&rsquo;t seem to let me do more than
one month at a time.  I finally got tired of that, but then went back
to check the Gmail view.</p>

<p>My mistake was thinking &ldquo;Done&rdquo; in the Inbox app meant &ldquo;mark as Read&rdquo;
in the Gmail app, which was wrong.  So I&rsquo;d moved hundreds of messages
out of my Inbox to who knows where.  Well now we all know they no
longer had the Inbox label and now had the Done label or state.  (And,
yes, I&rsquo;m now going to stop using the quotes around all of these states
and labels).  Also, as we all should know, in Gmail, you don&rsquo;t move
anything but only ever add and remove labels.</p>

<p>Well, that was a big change.  Part of my Gmail organization, written
about recently, is how I keep some things in the Inbox and some bypass
it and are only in labels.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;d moved the Inbox-only items completely out of site, read or
unread.</p>

<p>Thinking quickly, too quickly, and acting too quickly, I realized I
could try the search &ldquo;label:done&rdquo; and find them all.  So I just took
that list, clicked the upper left box to check all on the screen, then
checked the little link that always pops up that says, &ldquo;Select all
messages that match this search&hellip;&rdquo; to select <em>all</em> of the Done
items.  Then I just added the Inbox label back to them.</p>

<p>Except now I move a lot of messages (again, hundreds) into the Inbox
that formerly my filter had kept from ever being in the Inbox.  My
levels of email importance, and the underlying sorting, are something
like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only in the Inbox</li>
<li>In the Inbox but with a label</li>
<li>Only in a label (not in the Inbox)</li>
<li>Only in a label and marked as read on delivery</li>
</ul>


<p>I should have included that list in my previous post.</p>

<p>I was finally able to mostly clean up this mess by selecting the
various labels, select all of the messages, which now had the Inbox
label, and click the Archive operation.  Archive is Gmail-speak for
special operation that just removes the Inbox label.</p>

<p>I should never have believed that the Inbox app would be harmless and
wouldn&rsquo;t have some effect on my regular Gmail account.  Gmail
desperately wants to manage my email for me (to the point of just
taking it over) and, as much as I really like Gmail and think it&rsquo;s by
far the best email solution, I have to beat it down hard with a big
stick every time it raises it&rsquo;s head and tries to attack my email with
unwanted help.  It&rsquo;s exhausting.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a metaphor for Google in general and will probably eventually
lead, in some large part, to their downfall.</p>

<p>I still like a lot about the Inbox app and it&rsquo;s interface and I&rsquo;ll
keep experimenting with a much less important account.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the Apple Support Communities, Linc Davis gives an excellent
answer to this question with a summary of the built-in security
features of OS X 10.10 and the additional precautions you should take.</p>

<blockquote><p>All versions of OS X since 10.6.7 have been able to detect known
Mac malware in downloaded files, and to block insecure web
plugins. This feature is transparent to the user. Internally Apple
calls it &ldquo;XProtect.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Starting with OS X 10.7.5, there has been a second layer of
built-in malware protection, designated &ldquo;Gatekeeper&rdquo; by Apple. By
default, applications and Installer packages downloaded from the
network will only run if they&rsquo;re digitally signed by a developer with
a certificate issued by Apple. Software certified in this way hasn&rsquo;t
necessarily been tested by Apple, but you can be reasonably sure that
it hasn&rsquo;t been modified by anyone other than the developer. His
identity is known to Apple, so he could be held legally responsible if
he distributed malware. That may not mean much if the developer lives
in a country with a weak legal system (see below.)</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Starting with OS X 10.8.3, a third layer of protection has been
added: a &ldquo;Malware Removal Tool&rdquo; (MRT). MRT runs automatically in the
background when you update the OS. It checks for, and removes, malware
that may have evaded the other protections via a Java exploit (see
below.) MRT also runs when you install or update the Apple-supplied
Java runtime (but not the Oracle runtime.) Like XProtect, MRT is
effective against known threats, but not against unknown ones. It
notifies you if it finds malware, but otherwise there&rsquo;s no user
interface to MRT.</p></blockquote>

<p>His answer is the third one down.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve used email since the beginning of the early days of the
Internet&rsquo;s explosion in the mid-80s.  It&rsquo;s gone through quite an
evolution as have my methods of managing what is probably a massive
flood of incoming information.  Since my methods work pretty well for
me, I really wouldn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Lately I hear people either discussing how they fight their huge
battle with email, sometimes winning and sometimes losing, and I&rsquo;m
struck by how often they seem to miss some techniques I&rsquo;ve taken for granted
for years now.</p>

<p>In my current job I spend about 20 minutes reading email in the
morning.  After that, all of the email labels (basically folders if
that&rsquo;s the paradigm you use) are read, I&rsquo;m at what is sometimes called
&ldquo;inbox zero.&rdquo;  Throughout the rest of the day, I watch for occasional
emails from my team and the chain of people I report to.  That&rsquo;s
basically it.  I never see an email message that I wouldn&rsquo;t want to.</p>

<p>Here are the main techniques that I&rsquo;ve found success in using.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&rsquo;t recall hearing of NixOS Linux until a tweet crossed my Twitter
feed about a new release during the week between Christmas and New
Year&rsquo;s.  I looked it up and was fascinating by the new ideas and
approaches there.  Here&rsquo;s my awkward summar.</p>

<ul>
<li>Packages are immutable, like values in a functional language. Making configuration changes involves generating a new package.</li>
<li>Each package instance, each version, is stored on the system in it&rsquo;s
own directory.  Files aren&rsquo;t installed all over the place in /usr/local/lib, /usr/lib, /usr/local/bin, etc.</li>
<li>Due to the above, aliases are much more important than search paths.</li>
<li>Also, the dependency tree for a package is very straightforward.</li>
<li>System configuration is via a functional language and is a single expression in one file.</li>
<li>So you can easily boot and run any configuration, back out changes, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>I installed it on a Virtual box VM and played with it briefly.  One of
the first negative things I noticed was a ps listing.  Since each
package instance is under a single nixos directory with a directory
named by a long random hash, and since every running process is in a
bin directory (or some such) in one of those, the path to any running
program is a bear.</p>

<p>I pulled down nginx.  That was easy.  But then I went to configure it
and that&rsquo;s where I came face to face with NixOS&#8217; trade off.  You don&rsquo;t
change files in a package.  As I understand it so far, you add code
into the single configuration file that essentially edits, in this
case, the nginx config file in a sort of sed-like way, and produces a
new package instance that is used.  So a nice and simple config file
from nginx was turned into a functional language expression that now
requires me to go learn that language.</p>

<p>I stopped at that point but I&rsquo;m still fascinated by the distribution
and the ideas there.  There are some nice hard lines and properties of
cleanliness here.  Once the investment is made in learning the Nix
config language, it may be straightforward to move on and maintain
systems.  For a simple server instance this may be something to try.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ll move on with it soon and see how it goes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From looking at my development directories, it appears that it was in
early 2008 that I moved my personal source code control system from
CVS to Bazaar.  (Before that I&rsquo;d used RCS and even SCCS) I learned
about Bazaar from a coworker, John.  It was Python-based, the system
used by Canonical for Ubuntu and I found it to work extremely well.
Since then, for seven years now, I&rsquo;ve used it for my personal version
management and also as a shadow version control system at work.</p>

<p>It has been extremely stable for me, fast, and I can&rsquo;t think of any
trouble I&rsquo;ve ever had with Bazaar.  However, lately I&rsquo;ve seen
indications that Bazaar is no longer maintained and may be declining
as a version control choice.  Maybe it was never that popular.</p>

<p>Lately, Git seems to be the version control system of choice and it is
the system I use every day for work.  I&rsquo;m wondering if I should start
using it for my personal work.  The command set and, as they say, &ldquo;the
workflow&rdquo; is different.  It&rsquo;s not friendly to large binary blobs.
That&rsquo;s probably okay.</p>

<p>I already like it less because, if I want to make a branch of a
particular version or another branch to work on, there needs to be a
root branch of sorts, a hub to clone the other branch from.  With
Bazaar you can just branch any branch, merge changes from it, etc.  So
now I&rsquo;ll have to make some local hub to clone, push and pull from.
Yech.  That seems so archaic now.</p>

<p>However, I found this blog post by Jelmer Vernooij who was a primary
developer of Bazaar.  He basically tells the complete history and also
how it&rsquo;s finally been abandoned for the most part.  So, I guess I
should start moving on to git.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t even try to convert over my current bzr projects.  There is
Mercurial which may be worth a look.  Ah well.</p>

<blockquote><p>Contributions from people outside of the Canonical Bazaar team had
become rare by mid-2011. In early 2012 the members of the Canonical
Bazaar team were assigned to other projects, though we would still fix
the occasional bug in Bazaar. Martin left Canonical in April 2012.</p>

<p>During my spare time in the first 6 months of 2012 I tried to finish
my remaining in-progress branches. After that, I thought I would see
how it would go.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s time to move on. There are still some things I don&rsquo;t like
about it, but Git is a decent source code management system. Bazaar
isn&rsquo;t going anywhere; no doubt there will be users for a few years to
come, and people contributing fixes, but it hasn&rsquo;t been adopted to the
level I was hoping.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From Wired by Joao Medeiros.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hawking is very attached to his voice: in 1988, when Speech Plus gave
him the new synthesizer, the voice was different so he asked them to
replace it with the original. His voice had been created in the early
&lsquo;80s by MIT engineer Dennis Klatt, a pioneer of text-to-speech
algorithms. He invented the DECtalk, one of the first devices to
translate text into speech. He initially made three voices, from
recordings of his wife, daughter and himself. The female’s voice was
called &ldquo;Beautiful Betty&rdquo;, the child’s &ldquo;Kit the Kid&rdquo;, and the male
voice, based on his own, &ldquo;Perfect Paul.&rdquo; &ldquo;Perfect Paul&rdquo; is Hawking&rsquo;s
voice.</p></blockquote>
