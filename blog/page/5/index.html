  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a posted discussion Jeff Atwood claims that, &ldquo;For several years now
we&rsquo;ve tracked the fact that, over time from 2012 onward, Android
JavaScript performance has become wildly divergent from iOS JavaScript
performance. And not in a good way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He says:</p>

<blockquote><p>This is the benchmark most representative of Discourse performance,
and the absolute best known Android score for this benchmark is right
at ~400ms on a Samsung Galaxy S6. That doesn&rsquo;t seem too bad until you
compare..</p>

<p>iPhone 5 → 340ms<br />
iPhone 5s → 175ms<br />
iPhone 6 → 140ms<br />
iPad Air 2 → 120ms<br />
iPhone 6s → 60-70ms</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the fastest known Android device available today &mdash; and
there are millions of Android devices much slower than that out there
&mdash; performs 5× slower than a new iPhone 6s, and a little worse than a
2012 era iPhone 5 in Ember. How depressing.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For some reason, the chat paradigm has become overly popular.  Internet
relay chat (IRC) was interesting in the mid-90s as a way to
communicate in an informal, unstructured sense.  However, I can&rsquo;t
believe it&rsquo;s still so popular.  Then we have Hipchat, Slack and
others.  What&rsquo;s the deal?</p>

<p>What is the utility of an endless scroll of mixed up and confused,
uncollated, blended conversations with no good way to determine their
topics or context?</p>

<p>Maybe it is the valid rebellion against email.  I thought for a while
that email had reached the end of its usefulness.  However, in my own
personal quest for a substitute, I&rsquo;ve reluctantly come to the
conclusion that email is the only workable, reliable solution.</p>

<p>Granted phone text messages are how I normally communicate with my
family.  Beyond my immediate family, family and friends are all on
Facebook.  One or two people still seem to use Google+ and, of course,
most Google employees.</p>

<p>Email has subjects, labels and excellent search.  It accommodates
messages of any length, including super short.</p>

<p>I do like the idea of minimal email and Google Inbox makes a valiant
attempt but I expect it to be squashed any minute as is the end of all
Google services, useful or not, end up.  Ultimately, the native, plain
old Gmail is actually quite minimal when you really look at it.  Each
message in a conversation has the names of the people, a picture of
the sender and the message.  It looks like chat.</p>

<p>One personal change I&rsquo;ve made quietly over the past few months is to
drop all signatures including just signing my name on email messages.
The truth is we still have a compulsion to write an email message like
a letter or office memo, and not like a tweet or chat snippet.  I&rsquo;ll
still write in complete, hopefully correct, sentences with correct
spelling.  When corresponding with someone I don&rsquo;t often send email
to, then I&rsquo;m less familiar and will include my first name or full name
and maybe even a signature if it&rsquo;s a business message.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is a blog post I published in Mon 2010-11-22 on the previous
<a href="http://monolith149daily.blogspot.com/2010/11/blue-moon-definition-was-wrong.html">Monolith149 Daily
Site</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>What does this mean?  According to the &ldquo;new incorrect definition&rdquo; the
 blue moon was this past week 31 Jul (based on time zone actually) but
 the next &ldquo;old correct definition&rdquo; blue moon is not actually until 2016-05-21!</em></p>

<p>From a Space.com article by Joe Rao.</p>

<p>I was wrong.  My wife said last night that the moon was a blue moon.
I said, that&rsquo;s not possible because a blue moon is a second full moon
in the same month and that couldn&rsquo;t happen on 21 Nov.  It has to
happen at the very end of a month.  She pointed me at the above
article that explains it.</p>

<p>The short answer is that the two full moons in a month definition is
actually erroneous.</p>

<p>Rao notes that Lawrence J. Lafleur, in <em>Sky and Telescope</em> in 1943,
quotes a 1937 edition of the <em>Maine Farmer&rsquo;s Almanac</em>, stating that a
blue moon is the rare occurance of four full moons in a season instead
of three.  The blue moon is the third moon in that season.</p>

<p>The mistake was apparently made by James Hugh Pruett in a 1946 <em>Sky and
Telescope</em> where he misinterpreted Lafleur&rsquo;s explanation to mean a
second full moon in a single month.  (See the above article for
details).</p>

<p>The wrong explanation was propagated by Deborah Byrd in the radio
program &ldquo;Stardate&rdquo; in 1980 and then the wrong definition, quoting Rao,
&ldquo;went viral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It all makes me wonder when I first learned of the
two-full-moons-in-a-month definition.  I would have thought it was
long before 1980, but maybe it was after that date.</p>

<p>Well it sort of spoils the whole thing.  Now we&rsquo;ll have to talk about
old-correct-definition blue moons and new-incorrect-definition blue
moons and none of them will seem quite right any more.</p>

<p>This would all be a lot simpler if the moon would just actually turn
blue once in a while.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>At a time when professional astronomers held little regard for amateur
observers beyond their meteor and variable-star reports, Haas changed
the paradigm. First, he published (in 1938, at age 21) his in-depth
observations of brightness changes around major lunar craters. Then,
four years later, he followed with a four-part, 76-page opus titled
&ldquo;Does Anything Ever Happen on the Moon?&rdquo; that appeared in the Journal
of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. These became the opening
salvo in a lifelong quest &ldquo;to arouse interest in a neglected branch of
astronomy.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>On March 1, 1947, while still at UNM, he dispatched a self-produced
6-page newsletter titled The Strolling Astronomer. Haas already
envisioned this simple missive becoming something bigger: it was
subtitled &ldquo;Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers&rdquo; and branded
with &ldquo;Volume 1, Number 1.&rdquo; By the second issue, a month later, the
budding ALPO had grown to 41 members. Within six years, the
association boasted 350 members from all around the world.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An article from Tech Crunch by Jon Evans on how bad current interview
practices are.  It&rsquo;s quite interesting and echoes a lot of my
coworkers&#8217; and my recent sentiments.</p>

<blockquote><p>Traditional technical interviews are terrible for everyone. They’re a
bad way for companies to evaluate candidates. They’re a bad way for
candidates to evaluate companies. They waste time and generate stress
on both sides. Almost everyone, if pressed, will admit this. And yet
they persist.</p></blockquote>

<p>His solution:  Every candidate should bring with them a personal side
project the have done (this assumes a programming project) that they
can present in detail including code walk throughs and answering
questions.  The interviewer should be prepared to look at this in lieu
of asking white board questions and such.  This is a fascinating idea,
an excellent use of everyone&rsquo;s time, and could really change the whole
process for the better.  I don&rsquo;t hold a lot of hope this idea would
ever be widely adopted, if even adopted at all, but maybe.</p>

<time datetime="2015-03-23T08:13:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mon 23 Mar 2015  08:13 EDT</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, that was a mistake.  To a large degree I really like Gmail&rsquo;s new
Inbox IOS app, and the desktop version doesn&rsquo;t look bad either.  I&rsquo;ve
used it on a rarely-used account and recently added in anther,
more-often-used account so I could try out more interaction.  I heard
someone on a podcast say, It doesn&rsquo;t really affect your regular Gmail
interface interactions so you can use both at the same time.  That
seemed to be the case to me, so I thought, okay, I&rsquo;ll just fire it up
on my main Gmail account.</p>

<p>That was a mistake.</p>

<p>So it does have an effect in a particular way.  I should have seen
it.  The Gmail model is to treat messages like to do items and mark
them as &ldquo;Done&rdquo; when you are finished with them, instead of marking
them as &ldquo;Read.&rdquo;  Marking as &ldquo;Read&rdquo; is still there but it&rsquo;s
independent.  Of course, &ldquo;Done&rdquo; is yet another label though it doesn&rsquo;t
show up in the list of labels so maybe it&rsquo;s more a kind of state.
However, you can search in the regular Gmail for &ldquo;label:done&rdquo; and it
will find your done messages.  (That&rsquo;s giving away the ending).</p>

<p>With the Inbox app, you can go through and use the little &ldquo;sweep&rdquo;
icons to sweep away large collections of messages as &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; all in
one, uh, swoop.  Fortunately, it didn&rsquo;t seem to let me do more than
one month at a time.  I finally got tired of that, but then went back
to check the Gmail view.</p>

<p>My mistake was thinking &ldquo;Done&rdquo; in the Inbox app meant &ldquo;mark as Read&rdquo;
in the Gmail app, which was wrong.  So I&rsquo;d moved hundreds of messages
out of my Inbox to who knows where.  Well now we all know they no
longer had the Inbox label and now had the Done label or state.  (And,
yes, I&rsquo;m now going to stop using the quotes around all of these states
and labels).  Also, as we all should know, in Gmail, you don&rsquo;t move
anything but only ever add and remove labels.</p>

<p>Well, that was a big change.  Part of my Gmail organization, written
about recently, is how I keep some things in the Inbox and some bypass
it and are only in labels.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;d moved the Inbox-only items completely out of site, read or
unread.</p>

<p>Thinking quickly, too quickly, and acting too quickly, I realized I
could try the search &ldquo;label:done&rdquo; and find them all.  So I just took
that list, clicked the upper left box to check all on the screen, then
checked the little link that always pops up that says, &ldquo;Select all
messages that match this search&hellip;&rdquo; to select <em>all</em> of the Done
items.  Then I just added the Inbox label back to them.</p>

<p>Except now I move a lot of messages (again, hundreds) into the Inbox
that formerly my filter had kept from ever being in the Inbox.  My
levels of email importance, and the underlying sorting, are something
like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only in the Inbox</li>
<li>In the Inbox but with a label</li>
<li>Only in a label (not in the Inbox)</li>
<li>Only in a label and marked as read on delivery</li>
</ul>


<p>I should have included that list in my previous post.</p>

<p>I was finally able to mostly clean up this mess by selecting the
various labels, select all of the messages, which now had the Inbox
label, and click the Archive operation.  Archive is Gmail-speak for
special operation that just removes the Inbox label.</p>

<p>I should never have believed that the Inbox app would be harmless and
wouldn&rsquo;t have some effect on my regular Gmail account.  Gmail
desperately wants to manage my email for me (to the point of just
taking it over) and, as much as I really like Gmail and think it&rsquo;s by
far the best email solution, I have to beat it down hard with a big
stick every time it raises it&rsquo;s head and tries to attack my email with
unwanted help.  It&rsquo;s exhausting.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a metaphor for Google in general and will probably eventually
lead, in some large part, to their downfall.</p>

<p>I still like a lot about the Inbox app and it&rsquo;s interface and I&rsquo;ll
keep experimenting with a much less important account.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the Apple Support Communities, Linc Davis gives an excellent
answer to this question with a summary of the built-in security
features of OS X 10.10 and the additional precautions you should take.</p>

<blockquote><p>All versions of OS X since 10.6.7 have been able to detect known
Mac malware in downloaded files, and to block insecure web
plugins. This feature is transparent to the user. Internally Apple
calls it &ldquo;XProtect.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Starting with OS X 10.7.5, there has been a second layer of
built-in malware protection, designated &ldquo;Gatekeeper&rdquo; by Apple. By
default, applications and Installer packages downloaded from the
network will only run if they&rsquo;re digitally signed by a developer with
a certificate issued by Apple. Software certified in this way hasn&rsquo;t
necessarily been tested by Apple, but you can be reasonably sure that
it hasn&rsquo;t been modified by anyone other than the developer. His
identity is known to Apple, so he could be held legally responsible if
he distributed malware. That may not mean much if the developer lives
in a country with a weak legal system (see below.)</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Starting with OS X 10.8.3, a third layer of protection has been
added: a &ldquo;Malware Removal Tool&rdquo; (MRT). MRT runs automatically in the
background when you update the OS. It checks for, and removes, malware
that may have evaded the other protections via a Java exploit (see
below.) MRT also runs when you install or update the Apple-supplied
Java runtime (but not the Oracle runtime.) Like XProtect, MRT is
effective against known threats, but not against unknown ones. It
notifies you if it finds malware, but otherwise there&rsquo;s no user
interface to MRT.</p></blockquote>

<p>His answer is the third one down.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve used email since the beginning of the early days of the
Internet&rsquo;s explosion in the mid-80s.  It&rsquo;s gone through quite an
evolution as have my methods of managing what is probably a massive
flood of incoming information.  Since my methods work pretty well for
me, I really wouldn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Lately I hear people either discussing how they fight their huge
battle with email, sometimes winning and sometimes losing, and I&rsquo;m
struck by how often they seem to miss some techniques I&rsquo;ve taken for granted
for years now.</p>

<p>In my current job I spend about 20 minutes reading email in the
morning.  After that, all of the email labels (basically folders if
that&rsquo;s the paradigm you use) are read, I&rsquo;m at what is sometimes called
&ldquo;inbox zero.&rdquo;  Throughout the rest of the day, I watch for occasional
emails from my team and the chain of people I report to.  That&rsquo;s
basically it.  I never see an email message that I wouldn&rsquo;t want to.</p>

<p>Here are the main techniques that I&rsquo;ve found success in using.</p>
