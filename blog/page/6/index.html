<p>On 12 November 1971, exactly 43 years ago, Ray Bradbury spoke to an
audience at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the eve of Mariner 9
arriving at Mars.  On stage with him were Arthur C. Clarke, Carl
Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Walter Sullivan.  Bradbury read his poem, &ldquo;If
Only We Had Taller Been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today, on 12 November 2014, the Philae spacecraft &ldquo;docked&rdquo; with the
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.</p>

<p>From the ESA web site.</p>

<blockquote><p>Rosetta is a cornerstone mission to chase, go into orbit around, and
land on a comet. It is studying the Jupiter-family comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with a combination of remote sensing and in
situ measurements. The spacecraft arrived at the comet on 6 August
2014 following a 10-year journey through the Solar System. Between
August and November, the spacecraft has been orbiting the comet and
gathering data to characterise the environment and the comet
nucleus. On 12 November 2014, Rosetta&rsquo;s lander Philae will be deployed
to the surface. Philae carries a suite of instruments for imaging and
sampling the comet nucleus. The Rosetta orbiter will track the comet
through perihelion (August 2015), examining its behaviour before,
during and after.</p></blockquote>

<p>[SIC]:  I saw a pronunciation guide for Philae that said &ldquo;fee-lay.&rdquo;
This is wrong.  The pronunciation rhymes with eye-lee, or &ldquo;highly.&rdquo;
Whenever you see ae, it rhymes with ee as in leek.  For example,
Caesar.  And yes, the UNIX-famous word &ldquo;daemon&rdquo; is pronounced
precisely and exactly like demon. Other pronunciations are wrong.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are two key reasons that I&rsquo;m overjoyed to have made the switch
from Android to IOS and the iPhone.</p>

<p>One is the reliability of OS updates.  There&rsquo;s no worrying about
pure-Google vs. vendor-imposed-UI and junk apps. There&rsquo;s no waiting
for a vendor to either roll out an update or, more likely, just force
you to buy a new phone or wait for your cycle to end to get a new
phone.</p>

<p>The IOS updates are (so far) annual, universal and hassle
free.  And by hassel free I&rsquo;m referring to the above issues.  It&rsquo;s
granted there have been hiccups and bugs, but usually they are
resolved in a reasonable time.  I try to be cautious and wait for a
minor update or to before diving in.  Thus, I skipped 8.0 and waited
for 8.1.</p>

<p>The other joy is from the pictures the iPhones make.  There are
Android phones with better camera specs on paper, and yet, the photos
are often just not up to par.  My Galaxy Nexus made images that ranged
from okay to terrible.  When I go back and look at them now, they look
even worse than I realized.  I know other people disagree but I&rsquo;m
firmly in the camp: There&rsquo;s no contest here.</p>

<p>So, that makes two items removed from the list of things to have to
deal with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, It&rsquo;s now day 31 and I&rsquo;ve finished the <a href="/m149daily-blog/blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">30-day challenge</a> to blog for 30
days.  The original challenge that I read didn&rsquo;t include weekends but I
went ahead and blogged straight through since there&rsquo;s actually more
time to write on the weekend than during the week.</p>

<p>I did manage to put a post up every day with the exception of day 23.
I wrote the day 22 and 23 entries on day 22 using my Kindle HD Fire,
Draft and Dropbox and didn&rsquo;t actually post them until day 24.  I
didn&rsquo;t actually do any writing on day 23.  I&rsquo;ll leave it to the 30-day
blogging judges to decide how to count that.</p>

<p>Some posts were long, some were medium length, some had pictures and
links, some were only a link, a couple were basically just
&ldquo;re-tweets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reflecting on the experience I&rsquo;m amazed at how short 30 days is.  It
doesn&rsquo;t seem like there are 30+ posts and it felt like a much shorter
time.  But then, 30 days, months, years do seem to go by super-fast
lately.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the freedom of not hesitating to write the short,
tweet-length posts and then working on the longer ones when I had
something to say.  I didn&rsquo;t work hard to find pictures to add but only
used them when I felt they were appropriate or needed.  Just writing
words was okay and that freedom made it fun and doable.</p>

<p>The thing I liked the least about the experience was the quality of my
writing which I think is considerably decreased from what it used to
be.  I could have put more effort into better writing but I was just
getting some words down.  In essense, I was publishing maybe the
second draft of what I wrote, but not a &ldquo;final draft.&rdquo;  That was the
most dissatisfying part.  I got into the habit of writing but maybe
not writing well or at least better. Maybe that will be the next
challenge I take on, to write at least as well as I think I used to.</p>

<p>Another result of all of this blogging was a better work flow.  I
fixed my process by smoothing out lot of friction in the steps I take
to post.  I wrote a fully-automated script so I can locally publish
the blog (I actually do proof read entries there, spell check and see
how they look), and then push the update to public on Github with a
single command.  I fixed emacs to automatically go into text mode and
made some changes on Github to make pushing easier.</p>

<p>One of the lessons other bloggers shared as they were doing this
process was the appropriateness of the mid-length post.  That means
it&rsquo;s okay to write more than a tweet but less than a long essay.
That&rsquo;s part of the life-blood of journaling.  Sometimes you just pen a
brief entry but that&rsquo;s enough to stake out that day.  Being able to go
beyond 140 characters is a chief advantage that puts blogging above
tweeting while keeping the ability to write as little as desired.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to enjoy writing in Markdown even more.  It&rsquo;s simple to use
and, in the end, I have a completely readable and portable collection
of text files that aren&rsquo;t tied to a particular platform or site.  I
can take this site anywhere now.</p>

<p>One down side is that I&rsquo;m running up against the performance of
Octopress.  At this very point it takes 35 seconds of wall clock time
to generate the site.  That&rsquo;s not bad but it seems like a long wait in
computer &ldquo;waiting for a command to finish&rdquo; time.  I think I need to
look into breaking off the archives into a separate site or section so
they are generated independently.  Most of the archive, all of it
really, is static at this point and shouldn&rsquo;t need to be regenerated
for every post.  However, there would be some tricks in blending it in
to the main site, e.g., so that search covers the whole site including
archives.  It might be as simple as a different repo on Github and
posting it as a separate site with a different name but the exact same
look and feel.  There&rsquo;s more research, thinking and maybe
experimenting to do here.</p>

<p>So what next?  I&rsquo;m not going to focus on making sure I post something
every day.  I think I&rsquo;ll keep blogging more than I was for a while.
I&rsquo;m definitely going to take advantage of the freedom to blog anyway
way I wish, long or short, elaborate or trivially simple.  I&rsquo;m going
to read more blogs by other folks that have taken up the challenge and
try to benefit from their lessons learned.</p>

<p>When I started the 30 days, I brainstormed a nice long list of post
ideas in just a few minuts. After managing to cover a lot of them and
adding ideas through the month, amazingly, the list doesn&rsquo;t seem
any shorter.  There&rsquo;s still a lot to write about!</p>

<p><a href="/m149daily-blog/blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 30</a></p>

<p>Today I upgraded to IOS 8.1 with no trouble and it&rsquo;s working well so
far.</p>

<p>I am one of those users who doesn&rsquo;t have the 5-GB or so of space on my
iPhone to do an over-the-air upgrade.  In spite of that, you can do an
upgrade without needing the space if you connect your iPhone to your
Mac (or Windows?) running iTunes and use iTunes to do the upgrade.  It
does the downloading and expansion of files on your desktop machine
then installs the upgrade over the USB cable.</p>

<p>The upgrade/install went without any trouble and it took almost
exactly 36 minutes it predicted.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve not used it too much.  So far, all the apps look and work the
same as in IOS 7.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/m149daily-blog/blog/2014/10/11/blogging-for-30-days/">Day 29</a></p>

<p>I finally did something I&rsquo;ve meant to do for a while.  I configured
emacs to automatically use text-mode and auto-fill-mode for Markdown
files.  Markdown files end in either <strong>.markdown</strong> or <strong>.md</strong> in my
experience so far.  These blog posts are written in Markdown.</p>

<p>Since text-mode and auto-fill-mode weren&rsquo;t automatic, I had to execute
them manually using <strong>M-x</strong> (that&rsquo;s the ESC key followed by &ldquo;x&rdquo; in
emacs) everytime I opened one of those files, e.g., to write a blog
post.</p>

<p>Adding the following lines to my <strong>.emacs</strong> file in the home directory
fixed this.</p>

<pre><code>;;; Add markdown files to text-mode.
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.markdown\\'" . text-mode))
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.md\\'" . text-mode))

;;; Make auto-fill-mode the default for text-mode.
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
</code></pre>

<p>A final thought, but the most important one.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ll tell you the most important secret about telescopes and
observing, the thing that&rsquo;s more important than the aperture, more
important than how sturdy the mounting is, and more important than
portability.</p>

<p>Some parting thoughts.</p>

<h2>Magnification</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a common misconception that telescopes are all about
magnification.  One sure sign of a questionable telescope is one that
puts its magnification up front.  Worse is one that advertises 200x,
300x, and more.</p>
