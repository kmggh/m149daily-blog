  <div class="entry-content"><p>From looking at my development directories, it appears that it was in
early 2008 that I moved my personal source code control system from
CVS to Bazaar.  (Before that I&rsquo;d used RCS and even SCCS) I learned
about Bazaar from a coworker, John.  It was Python-based, the system
used by Canonical for Ubuntu and I found it to work extremely well.
Since then, for seven years now, I&rsquo;ve used it for my personal version
management and also as a shadow version control system at work.</p>

<p>It has been extremely stable for me, fast, and I can&rsquo;t think of any
trouble I&rsquo;ve ever had with Bazaar.  However, lately I&rsquo;ve seen
indications that Bazaar is no longer maintained and may be declining
as a version control choice.  Maybe it was never that popular.</p>

<p>Lately, Git seems to be the version control system of choice and it is
the system I use every day for work.  I&rsquo;m wondering if I should start
using it for my personal work.  The command set and, as they say, &ldquo;the
workflow&rdquo; is different.  It&rsquo;s not friendly to large binary blobs.
That&rsquo;s probably okay.</p>

<p>I already like it less because, if I want to make a branch of a
particular version or another branch to work on, there needs to be a
root branch of sorts, a hub to clone the other branch from.  With
Bazaar you can just branch any branch, merge changes from it, etc.  So
now I&rsquo;ll have to make some local hub to clone, push and pull from.
Yech.  That seems so archaic now.</p>

<p>However, I found this blog post by Jelmer Vernooij who was a primary
developer of Bazaar.  He basically tells the complete history and also
how it&rsquo;s finally been abandoned for the most part.  So, I guess I
should start moving on to git.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t even try to convert over my current bzr projects.  There is
Mercurial which may be worth a look.  Ah well.</p>

<blockquote><p>Contributions from people outside of the Canonical Bazaar team had
become rare by mid-2011. In early 2012 the members of the Canonical
Bazaar team were assigned to other projects, though we would still fix
the occasional bug in Bazaar. Martin left Canonical in April 2012.</p>

<p>During my spare time in the first 6 months of 2012 I tried to finish
my remaining in-progress branches. After that, I thought I would see
how it would go.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s time to move on. There are still some things I don&rsquo;t like
about it, but Git is a decent source code management system. Bazaar
isn&rsquo;t going anywhere; no doubt there will be users for a few years to
come, and people contributing fixes, but it hasn&rsquo;t been adopted to the
level I was hoping.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Hawking is very attached to his voice: in 1988, when Speech Plus gave
him the new synthesizer, the voice was different so he asked them to
replace it with the original. His voice had been created in the early
&lsquo;80s by MIT engineer Dennis Klatt, a pioneer of text-to-speech
algorithms. He invented the DECtalk, one of the first devices to
translate text into speech. He initially made three voices, from
recordings of his wife, daughter and himself. The female’s voice was
called &ldquo;Beautiful Betty&rdquo;, the child’s &ldquo;Kit the Kid&rdquo;, and the male
voice, based on his own, &ldquo;Perfect Paul.&rdquo; &ldquo;Perfect Paul&rdquo; is Hawking&rsquo;s
voice.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a time of Richard Branson and Virgin Galactic, along with
impressive amateur rocketeers and commercial space ventures, we might
have forgotten about Bob Truax, one of the first commercial, private
rocket jockeys.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia,</p>

<blockquote><p>Truax also designed the Skycycle X-2, which he unsuccessfully tested
on April 15, 1972 and June 24, 1973, and which Evel Knievel
unsuccessfully used at the Snake River Canyon in 1974.</p></blockquote>

<p>And also,</p>

<blockquote><p>The X-3 Volksrocket (other names: Arriba One, Skycycle X-3) was a
reusable space tourism rocket planned by Robert Truax after Evel
Knievel provided a $1,000 research grant for a pilot study. Truax
was looking for volunteers with enough money to help fund the effort
and who wished to fly aboard his rocket. He got thousands of
volunteers, but few of them had the financial resources.</p>

<p>The rocket used surplus components and was tested through 1991.</p></blockquote>

<p>There was actually a TV show based on Truax called <em>Salvage 1</em> and
starring Andy Griffith in 1979.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do worm holes even exist?  At Smithsonian.com, Victoria Jaggard
writes the article &ldquo;Would Astronauts Survive an Interstellar Trip Through a
Wormhole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Given the state of current physics the answer is, No.  The idea of
worm holes has come and gone in the science world, though it never
quite leaves.  The Kerr metric solution to Einstein&rsquo;s general
relativity equations applies to &ldquo;rotating&rdquo; black holes and adds new
twists, however there&rsquo;s still not really a way for humans to get
through.</p>

<p>Just like crossing an event horizon is beyond the edge of our
universe, these ideas are beyond the edge of our science.  Of course
we don&rsquo;t know everything and I have no doubt there are amazing things
still to be discovered.  I&rsquo;d never say it can&rsquo;t happen, just that we
don&rsquo;t have a good mechanism in our current astrophysics toolbox unless
we toss in a little magic.  Just like it is with faster-than-light
travel.</p>

<blockquote><p>Despite his ties to the film, [cosmologist Kip] Thorne is also
pessimistic that a traversable wormhole is even possible, much less
survivable. &ldquo;If they can exist, I doubt very much that they can form
naturally in the astrophysical universe,&rdquo; he writes in the book. But
Thorne appreciates that Christopher and Jonah Nolan, who wrote
Interstellar, were so keen to tell a story that is grounded in
science.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s more to come on this topic and other folks have weighed in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>A team of astronomers using the Subaru Telescope&rsquo;s Suprime-Cam to
perform the Subaru Ultra-Deep Survey for Lyman-alpha Emitters have
looked back more than [<em>z=7</em>] to find 7 early galaxies that
appeared quite suddenly within 700 million years of the Big Bang. The
team, led by graduate student Akira Konno and Dr. Masami Ouchi
(Associate Professor at the University of Tokyo&rsquo;s ICRR) was looking
for a specific kind of galaxy called a Lyman-alpha emitter (LAE), to
understand the role such galaxies may have played in an event called
&ldquo;cosmic reionization&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<p>The team looked at distant galaxies that primarily emit Lyman-alpha
radiation, &ldquo;Lyman-alpha emitters&rdquo; or LAE, and saw fewer than expected,
further back in time.  There&rsquo;s an apparent sudden cutoff at that
redshift.  The redshift corresponds to a distance and time in history
that&rsquo;s model dependent.  The standard big bang model would put this at
about 13.1 billion years and only 700 million years after the big bang
itself.  The cosmological-history implication is that these galaxies
&ldquo;suddenly&rdquo; appear.</p>

<p>One thing is pretty certain.  A cosmological redshift of seven
indicates the universe was about 1/8 it&rsquo;s current size at the time the
light they observed was emitted.  That&rsquo;s 1 / (<em>z</em> + 1).</p>

<blockquote><p>According to the team&rsquo;s analysis, one reason that LAEs appeared very
quickly is cosmic reionization. LAEs in the epoch of cosmic
reionization became darker than the actual luminosity due to the
presence of the neutral hydrogen fog. In the team&rsquo;s analysis of their
observations, they suggest the possibility that the neutral fog
filling the universe was cleared about 13.0 billion years ago and LAEs
suddenly appeared in sight for the first time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, there are other possibilities to explain why LAEs appeared
suddenly,&rdquo; said Dr. Ouchi, who is the principal investigator of this
program. &ldquo;One is that clumps of neutral hydrogen around LAEs
disappeared. Another is that LAEs became intrinsically bright. The
reason of the intrinsic brightening is that the Lyman-alpha emission
is not efficiently produced by the ionized clouds in a LAE due to the
significant escape of ionizing photons from the galaxy. In either
case, our discovery is an important key to understanding cosmic
reionization and the properties of the LAEs in early universe.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
